    "### Topic Modeling : 문서 집합에 숨어 있는 주제를 찾아 내는 것. 머신러닝 기반의 토픽 모델은 숨겨진 주제를 효과적으로 표현 할 수 있는 중심 단어를 함축적으로 추출. 머신러닝 기반 토픽 모델링에 자주 사용되는 기법은 LSA, NMF, LDA 입니다.  \n",
    "- 토픽 모델링에서는 주요 토픽의 분포도와 개별 토픽이 어떤의 의미인지, 단어들의 분포를 제공하고 있다. \n",
    "- 단어 분포나 구성을 보고 분석가가 주제를 유추 할 수 있다\n",
    "- 토픽모델링의 단점으로는 초기화 파라미터나 Documnet Term 행렬의 단어 필터링 최적화가 어렵고 사람의 주관적인 해석이 들어가는 것이 단점.\n",

       " 'Most of this discussion has been between Mark Singer and David Tate,\\nwith Valentine weighing in on the same side as Dave at various times.\\nMy opinion, FWIW, to all:\\n\\nMark, age doesn\\'t matter; ability does. I would rather have the untried\\nrookie with great minor league numbers than the veteran who has proven\\nhimself to be average at best. I don\\'t care if he is 15; if he plays\\nbetter than what I have, I want him out there. Sandy Alomar had decent\\nminor league numbers, grossly inflated by the PCL in general and Las\\nVegas in particular; he should have been projected as an average major\\nleague hitter (which is good for a catcher, I\\'ll admit). Santiago\\'s\\nnumbers would probably come out the same as Sandy\\'s, but I don\\'t have\\nthe league data from the mid-80s to check it out.\\n\\nThat being said, I agree with sending Lopez to Richmond, at least to\\nstart the season. As the box below shows, he has *one* minor league\\nseason in which he hit well. He has two in which he hit very, very\\npoorly. I want to see that the 92 Lopez is real. Olson and Berryhill\\nare not complete mediocrities; for catchers, especially NL catchers,\\nthey are essentially average hitters, with equivalent averages around\\n.220. If he had hit well at prior levels, I would say he belongs on\\nthe Braves; but there is a reasonable chance that Lopez last year was\\njust as much a fluke as Alomar in 90 or Santiago in 87.

The makefile will be arranged to execute a\\nX       build shell script containing the \\'build\\' information.  The name of\\nX       this build shell script will be your entry\\'s title, possibly followed\\nX       by a digit, followed by \\'.sh\\'.\\nX\\nX       If needed, your entry\\'s remarks should indicate how your entry must\\nX       be changed in order to deal with the new filenames.\\nX\\nX    5) The build file, the source and the resulting executable should be\\nX       treated as read-only files.  If your entry needs to modify these files,\\nX       it should make and modify a copy of the appropriate file.  If this\\nX       occurs, state so in your entry\\'s remarks.\\nX\\nX    6) Entries that cannot be compiled by an ANSI C compiler will be rejected.\\nX       Use of common C (K&R + extensions) is permitted, as long as it does not\\nX       cause compile errors for ANSI C compilers.\\nX\\nX    7) The program must be of original work.

The guidelines should be viewed as hints and suggestions.\\nX    Entries that violate the guidelines but remain within the rules are\\nX    allowed.  Even so, you are safer if you remain within the guidelines.\\nX\\nX    You should read the current IOCCC rules, prior to submitting entries.\\nX    The rules are typically sent out with these guidelines.\\nX\\nX    Changes from the 1993 draft are noted by change bars.  --->\\t\\t      |\\nX\\nX\\nXWHAT IS NEW IN 1993:\\nX\\nX    The entry format is better (for us anyway).  The program mkentry.c\\nX    has been updated.  See ENTRY FORMAT.\\nX\\nX    We will reject entries that cannot be compiled using an ANSI C\\nX    compiler.  Certain old Obfuscation hacks that cause ANSI C compilers\\nX    fits are no longer permitted.  Some of the new issues deal with\\nX    non-integral array types, variable number of arguments, C preprocessor\\nX    directives and the exit() function.  See OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES.\\nX\\nX\\nXHINTS AND SUGGESTIONS:\\nX\\nX    You are encouraged to examine the winners of previous contests.  See\\nX    FOR MORE INFORMATION for details on how to get previous winners.\\nX\\nX    Keep in mind that rules change from year to year, so some winning entries\\nX    may not be valid entries this year.  What was unique and novel one year\\nX    might be \\'old\\' the next year.\\nX\\nX    An entry is usually examined in a number of ways.  We typically apply\\nX    a number of tests to an entry:\\nX\\nX\\t* look at the original source\\nX\\t* convert ANSI tri-graphs to ASCII\\nX\\t* C pre-process the source ignoring \\'#include\\' lines\\nX\\t* C pre-process the source ignoring \\'#define\\' and \\'#include\\' lines\\nX\\t* run it through a C beautifier\\nX\\t* examine the algorithm\\nX\\t* lint it\\nX\\t* compile it\\nX\\t* execute it\\nX\\nX    You should consider how your entry looks in each of the above tests.\\nX    You should ask yourself if your entry remains obscure after it has been\\nX    \\'cleaned up\\' by the C pre-processor and a C beautifier.\\nX\\nX    Your entry need not do well under all, or in most tests.  In certain\\nX    cases, a test is not important.  Entries that compete for the\\nX    \\'strangest/most creative source layout\\' need not do as well as\\nX    others in terms of their algorithm.  On the other hand, given\\nX    two such entries, we are more inclined to pick the entry that\\nX    does something interesting when you run it.\\nX\\nX    We try to avoid limiting creativity in our rules.  As such, we leave\\nX    the contest open for creative rule interpretation.  As in real life\\nX    programming, interpreting a requirements document or a customer request\\nX    is important.  For this reason, we often award \\'worst abuse of the\\nX    rules\\' to an entry that illustrates this point in an ironic way.\\nX\\nX    If you do plan to abuse the rules, we suggest that you let us know\\nX    in the remarks section.  Please note that an invitation to abuse\\nX    is not an invitation to break.  We are strict when it comes to the\\nX    3217 byte size limit.  Also, abusing the entry format tends to\\nX    annoy more than amuse.\\nX\\nX    We do realize that there are holes in the rules, and invite entries\\nX    to attempt to exploit them.  We will award \\'worst abuse of the rules\\'\\nX    and then plug the hole next year.  Even so, we will attempt to use\\nX    the smallest plug needed, if not smaller.  :-)\\nX\\nX    Check out your program and be sure that it works.  We sometimes make\\nX    the effort to debug an entry that has a slight problem, particularly\\nX    in or near the final round.  On the other hand, we have seen some\\nX    of the best entries fall down because they didn\\'t work.\\nX\\nX    We tend to look down on a prime number printer, that claims that\\nX    16 is a prime number.  If you do have a bug, you are better off\\nX    documenting it.  Noting \"this entry sometimes prints the 4th power\\nX    of a prime by mistake\" would save the above entry.  And sometimes,\\nX    a strange bug/feature can even help the entry!  Of course, a correctly\\nX    working entry is best.\\nX\\nX\\nXOUR LIKES AND DISLIKES:\\nX\\nX    Doing masses of #defines to obscure the source has become \\'old\\'.  We\\nX    tend to \\'see thru\\' masses of #defines due to our pre-processor tests\\nX    that we apply.  Simply abusing #defines or -Dfoo=bar won\\'t go as far\\nX    as a program that is more well rounded in confusion.\\nX\\nX    Many ANSI C compilers dislike the following code, and so do we:\\nX\\nX\\t#define d define\\nX\\t#d foo\\t\\t   <-- don\\'t expect this to turn into #define foo\\nX\\nX\\tint i;\\nX\\tj;\\t\\t   <-- don\\'t use such implicit type declaration\\nX\\tint k;\\nX\\nX    We suggest that you compile your entry with an ANSI C compiler.  If you\\nX    must use non-ANSI C, such as K&R C, you must avoid areas that result in\\nX    compile/link errors for ANSI C compilers.\\nX\\nX    Unfortunately, some ANSI C compilers require array indexes to be of       |\\nX    integral type.  Thus, the following classical obfuscation hacks should    |\\nX    not be used in 1993.  This rule may be relaxed in future contests.\\t      |\\nX\\nX\\tint i;\\nX\\tchar *c;\\nX\\ti[c];\\t\\t   <--- use c[i] instead\\nX\\t(i+3)[\"string\"];   <--- use \"string\"[i+3] instead\\nX\\nX    If your entry uses functions that have a variable number of\\nX    arguments, be careful. Systems implement va_list as a wide variety\\nX    of ways.  Because of this, a number of operations using va_list are\\nX    not portable and must not be used:\\nX\\nX\\t* assigning a non-va_list variable to/from a va_list variable\\nX\\t* casting a non-va_list variable into/from a va_list variable\\nX\\t* passing a va_list variable to a function expecting a non-va_list arg\\nX\\t* passing a non-va_list variable to a function expecting a va_list arg\\nX\\t* performing arithmetic on va_list variables\\nX\\t* using va_list as a structure or union\\nX\\nX    In particular, do not treat va_list variables as if they were a char **\\'s.\\nX\\nX    Avoid using <varargs.h>, use <stdarg.h> instead.\\nX\\nX    If you use C preprocessor directives (#define, #if, #ifdef, ...),\\nX    the leading \\'#\\' must be the first character on a line.  While some\\nX    C preprocessors allow whitespace the leading \\'#\\', many do not.\\nX\\nX    Because the exit() function returns void on some systems, entries\\nX    must not assume that it returns an int.\\nX\\nX    Small programs are best when they are short, obscure and concise.\\nX    While such programs are not as complex as other winners, they do\\nX    serve a useful purpose.  They are often the only program that people\\nX    attempt to completely understand.  For this reason, we look for\\nX    programs that are compact, and are instructional.\\nX\\nX    One line programs should be short one line programs, say around 80\\nX    bytes long.  Getting close to 160 bytes is a bit too long in our opinion.\\nX\\nX    We tend to dislike programs that:\\nX\\nX\\t* are very hardware specific\\nX\\t* are very OS or Un*x version specific\\nX\\t     (index/strchr differences are ok, but socket/streams specific\\nX\\t      code is likely not to be)\\nX\\t* dump core or have compiler warnings\\nX\\t     (it is ok only if you warn us in the \\'remark\\' header item)\\nX\\t* won\\'t compile under both BSD or SYS V Un*x\\nX\\t* abusing the build file to get around the size limit\\nX\\t* obfuscate by excessive use of ANSI tri-graphs\\nX\\t* are longer than they need to be\\nX\\t* are similar to previous winners\\nX\\t* are identical to previous losers  :-)\\nX\\nX    Unless you are cramped for space, or unless you are entering the\\nX    \\'best one liner\\' category, we suggest that you format your program\\nX    in a more creative way than simply forming excessively long lines.\\nX\\nX    The build file should not be used to try and get around the size\\nX    limit.  It is one thing to make use of a several -D\\'s to help out,\\nX    but it is quite another to use 200+ bytes of -D\\'s in order to\\nX    try and squeeze the source under the size limit.  You should feel\\nX    free to make use of the build file space, but you are better off\\nX    if you show some amount of restraint.\\nX\\nX    We allowed whitespace, and in certain cases ; { or } do not impact\\nX    your program size (up to a certain point), because we want to get\\nX    away from source that is simply a compact blob of characters.\\nX\\nX    Given two versions of the same program, one that is a compact blob\\nX    of code, and the other that is formatted more like a typical C\\nX    program, we tend to favor the second version.  Of course, a third\\nX    version of the same program that is formatted in an interesting\\nX    and/or obfuscated way, would definitely win over the first two!\\nX\\nX    We suggest that you avoid trying for the \\'smallest self-replicating\\'\\nX    program.  We are amazed at the many different sizes that claim\\nX    to be the smallest.  There is nothing wrong with self-replicating\\nX    programs.  In fact, a number of winners have been self-replicating.\\nX    You might want to avoid the claim of \\'smallest\\', lest we (or others)\\nX    know of a smaller one!\\nX\\nX    X client entries should be as portable as possible.  Entries that\\nX    adapt to a wide collection of environments will be favored.  Don\\'t\\nX    depend on a particular type of display.  For example, don\\'t depend\\nX    on color or a given size.  Don\\'t require backing store.\\nX\\nX    X client entries should avoid using X related libraries and\\nX    software that is not in wide spread use.  We ask that such X client\\nX    entries restrict themselves to only the low level Xlib and the\\nX    Athena widget set (libX11.a, libXaw.a, libXmu.a and libXt.a).\\nX    Don\\'t use M*tif, Xv*ew, or OpenL*ok toolkits, since not everyone\\nX    has them.  Avoid depending on a particular window manager.  Not\\nX    everyone has X11r5, and some people are stuck back in X11r4 (or\\nX    earlier), so try to target X11r5 without requiring X11r5.  Better\\nX    yet, try to make your entry run on all version 11 X Window Systems.\\nX\\nX    X client entries should not to depend on particular items on\\nX    .Xdefaults.  If you must do so, be sure to note the required lines\\nX    in the ---remark--- section.\\nX\\nX    We like programs that:\\nX\\nX\\t* are as concise and small as they need to be\\nX\\t* do something at least quasi-interesting\\nX\\t* pass lint without complaint (not a requirement, but it is nice)\\nX\\t* are portable\\nX\\t* are unique or novel in their obfuscation style\\nX\\t* MAKE USE OF A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF OBFUSCATION\\nX\\t* make us laugh and/or throw up  :-)\\nX\\nX    Some types of programs can\\'t excel in some areas.  Of course, your\\nX    program doesn\\'t have to excel in all areas, but doing well in several\\nX    areas really does help.\\nX\\nX    We freely admit that interesting, creative or humorous comments in\\nX    the ---remark--- section helps your chance of winning.  If you had to\\nX    read of many twisted entries, you too would enjoy a good laugh or two.\\nX    We think the readers of the contest winners do as well.\\nX\\nX    Be creative!\\nX\\nX\\nXENTRY FORMAT:\\nX\\nX    In order to help us process the many entries, we must request your\\nX    assistance by formatting your entries in a certain way.  This format,\\nX    in addition, allows us to quickly separate information about the\\nX    author from the program itself.  (see JUDGING PROCESS)\\nX\\nX    We have provided the program, mkentry, as an example of how to\\nX    format entries.  You should be aware of the following warning that\\nX    is found in mkentry.c:\\nX\\nX\\tThis program attempts to implement the IOCCC rules.  Every\\nX\\tattempt has been made to make sure that this program produces\\nX\\tan entry that conforms to the contest rules.  In all cases,\\nX\\twhere this program differs from the contest rules, the\\nX\\tcontest rules will be used.  Be sure to check with the\\nX\\tcontest rules before submitting an entry.\\nX\\nX    You are not required to use mkentry.  It is convenient, however,\\nX    as it attempts to uuencode the needed files, and attempt to check\\nX    the entry against the size rules.\\nX\\nX    If you have any suggestions, comments, fixes or complaints about\\nX    the mkentry.c program, please send Email to the judges.

For example:\\nX\\nX\\t\\tcc prog.c -o special_name\\t\\tneed special binary\\nX\\nX\\t    or  rm -f special_src.c\\t\\t\\tneed special source\\nX\\t\\tcp prog.c special_src.c\\nX\\t\\tcc special_src.c -o special_name\\nX\\nX\\t    or  rm -f special_build\\t\\t\\tneed special build\\nX\\t\\ttail +4 build > special_build\\nX\\t\\tsh < special_build\\nX\\nX\\t* Assume that we will use the entry title.  Send us a version of\\nX\\t  your build/program files that uses the name convention.  You\\nX\\t  should uuencode these files in ---data--- sections.\\nX\\nX    If your entry needs to modify its source, info or binary files,\\nX    please say so in the ---remark--- section.  You should try to avoid\\nX    touching your original build, source and binary files.  You should\\nX    arrange to make copies of the files you intend to modify.  This\\nX    will allow people to re-generate your entry from scratch.\\nX\\nX    Remember that your entry may be built without a build file.  We\\nX    typically incorporate the build lines into a Makefile.  If the\\nX    build file must exist, say so in the ---remark--- section.\\nX\\nX    If your entry needs special info files, you should uuencode them\\nX    into ---info--- sections.  In the case of multiple info files,\\nX    use multiple ---info--- sections.  If no info files are needed,\\nX    then skip the ---info--- section.\\nX\\nX    Info files are intended to be input, or detailed information that\\nX    does not fit well into the ---remark--- section.  For example, an\\nX    entry that implements a compiler might want to provide some sample\\nX    programs for the user to compile.  An entry might want to include a\\nX    lengthy design document, that might not be appropriate for a\\nX    \\'hints\\' file.\\nX\\nX    Info files should be used only to supplement your entry.  For\\nX    example, info files may provide sample input or detailed\\nX    information about your entry.  Because they are supplemental,\\nX    the entry should not require them exist.\\nX\\nX    In some cases, your info files might be renamed to avoid name\\nX    conflicts.  If info files should not be renamed for some reason,\\nX    say so in the ---remark--- section.\\nX\\nX    Info files must uudecode into the current directory.  If they\\nX    absolutely must be renamed, or moved into a sub-directory, say\\nX    so in the ---remark--- section.\\nX\\nX    When submitting multiple entries, be sure that each entry has\\nX    a unique entry number from 0 to 7.  Your first entry should\\nX    have entry number 0.\\nX\\nX    With the exception of the header, all text outside of the entry\\nX    format may be ignored.  That is, don\\'t place text outside of the\\nX    entry and expect the judges to see it.  (Our decoding tools aren\\'t\\nX    AI progs!) If you need tell the the something, put it in the\\nX    ---remark--- section, or send a Email to the judges at:\\nX\\nX\\t...!{apple,pyramid,sun,uunet}!hoptoad!judges\\t(not the address for\\nX\\tjudges@toad.com\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t submitting entries)\\nX\\nX    The date should be given with respect to UTC.

An example of such a string is:\\nX\\nX\\tThr Apr 01 00:47:00 1993\\nX\\nX    This format is similar to the output of the date(1) command.  The\\nX    string does not include the timezone name before the year.

To do so, set\\nX    the \\'fix\\' line in the ---entry--- section to \\'y\\' instead of \\'n\\'.\\nX    Be sure that the resubmittion uses the same title and entry number\\nX    as well, as these are used to determine which entry is to be\\nX    replaced.\\nX\\nX\\nXJUDGING PROCESS:\\nX\\nX    Entries are judged by Larry Bassel and Landon Curt Noll.\\nX\\nX    Entries are unpacked into individual directories.  The Email message\\nX    is unpacked into individual files, each containing:\\nX\\nX\\t---entry--- section\\nX\\tall ---author--- sections\\nX\\tall ---info--- sections\\nX\\t---build--- section\\nX\\t---program--- section\\nX\\tany other text, including the Email message headers\\nX\\nX    Prior to judging, the \\'any other text\\' file is scanned to be sure\\nX    it does not contain useful information (or in case the entry was\\nX    malformed and did not unpack correctly).  Information from the\\nX    ---author--- sections are not read until the judging process is\\nX    complete, and then only from entries that have won an award.\\nX\\nX    The above process helps keep us biased for/against any one particular\\nX    individual.  We are usually kept in the dark as much as you are\\nX    until the final awards are given.  We like the surprise of finding\\nX    out in the end, who won and where they were from.\\nX\\nX    We attempt to keep all entries anonymous, unless they win an award.\\nX    Because the main \\'prize\\' of winning is being announced, we make all\\nX    attempts to send non-winners into oblivion.  We remove all non-winning\\nX    files, and shred all related paper.  By tradition, we do not even\\nX    reveal the number of entries that we received.  (for the curious,\\nX    we do indicate the volume of paper consumed when presenting the IOCCC\\nX    winners at talks)\\nX\\nX    After the Usenix announcement, we attempt to send Email to the\\nX    authors of the winning entries.  One reason we do this is to give\\nX    the authors a chance to comment on the way we have presented their\\nX    entry.  They are given the chance to correct mistakes, typos.  We\\nX    often accept their suggestions/comments about our remarks as well.\\nX    This is done prior to posting the winners to the wide world.\\nX\\nX    Judging consists of a number of elimination rounds.  During a round,\\nX    the collection of entries are divided into two roughly equal piles;\\nX    the pile that advances on to the next round, and the pile that does\\nX    not.  We also re-examine the entries that were eliminated in the\\nX    previous round.  Thus, an entry gets at least two readings.\\nX\\nX    A reading consists of a number of actions:\\nX\\nX\\t* reading the ---entry--- section\\nX\\t* reading the uudecoded ---build--- section\\nX\\t* reading the uudecoded ---program--- section\\nX\\t* reading the uudecoded ---info--- section(s), if any\\nX\\t* passing the source thru the C pre-processor\\nX\\t    shipping over any #include files\\nX\\t* performing a number of C beautify/cleanup edits on the source\\nX\\t* passing the beautified source thru the C pre-processor\\nX\\t    shipping over any #include files\\nX\\nX    In later rounds, other actions are performed:\\nX\\nX\\t* linting the source\\nX\\t* compiling/building the source\\nX\\t* running the program\\nX\\t* performing misc tests on the source and binary\\nX\\nX    Until we reduce the stack of entries down to about 25 entries, entries\\nX    are judged on an individual basis.  An entry is set aside because it\\nX    does not, in our opinion, meet the standard established by the round.\\nX    When the number of entries thins to about 25 entries, we begin to form\\nX    award categories.  Entries begin to compete with each other for awards.\\nX    An entry often will compete in several categories.\\nX\\nX    The actual award category list will vary depending on the types of entries\\nX    we receive.  A typical category list might be:\\nX\\nX\\t* best small one line program\\nX\\t* best small program\\nX\\t* strangest/most creative source layout\\nX\\t* most useful obfuscated program\\nX\\t* best game that is obfuscated\\nX\\t* most creatively obfuscated program\\nX\\t* most deceptive C code\\nX\\t* best X client (see OUR LIKES AND DISLIKES)\\nX\\t* best abuse of ANSI C\\nX\\t* worst abuse of the rules\\nX\\t* <anything else so strange that it deserves an award>\\nX\\nX    We do not limit ourselves to this list.  For example, a few entries are so\\nX    good/bad that they are declared winners at the start of the final round.\\nX    We will invent awards categories for them, if necessary.\\nX\\nX    In the final round process, we perform the difficult tasks of\\nX    reducing the remaining entries (typically about 25) down to 8 or 10\\nX    winners.  Often we are confident that the entries that make it into\\nX    the final round are definitely better than the ones that do not\\nX    make it.  The selection of the winners out of the final round, is\\nX    less clear cut.\\nX\\nX    Sometimes a final round entry good enough to win, but is beat out\\nX    by a similar, but slightly better entry.  For this reason, it is\\nX    sometimes worthwhile to re-enter an improved version of an entry\\nX    that failed to win in a previous year.  This assumes, of course,\\nX    that the entry is worth improving in the first place!\\nX\\nX    More often that not, we select a small entry (usually one line), a\\nX    strange/creative layout entry, and an entry that abuses the contest\\nX    rules in some way.\\nX\\nX    In the end, we traditionally pick one entry as \\'best\\'.  Sometimes such\\nX    an entry simply far exceeds any of the other entry.  More often, the\\nX    \\'best\\' is picked because it does well in a number of categories.\\nX\\nX\\nXANNOUNCEMENT OF WINNERS:\\nX\\nX    The first announcement, occurs at a Summer Usenix conference.

Ultasound(like that used in seeing the fetus \\nin the uterus) has been shown to be extremely good at picking up tumors \\nin the prostate and gallstones in the gallbladder.  But kidney tissue may \\nbe too dense for ultrasound to work for kidney stones(any radiologists care \\nto comment?).\\n\\nMost stones will pass(but it\\'s a very painful process).  Unlike gallstones, \\nI don\\'t think that there are many drugs that can help \"dissolve\" the \\nkidney stone(which is probably calcium-oxalate).  Vitamin C and magnesium \\nhave worked in rabbits to remove calcium from calcified plaques in the \\naterial wall.  I have no idea if a diet change or supplementation could \\nspeed up the process of kidney stone passage(but I\\'m pretty confident that \\na diet change and/or supplementation can prevent a reoccurance).  If surgery \\nis being contemplated, the stone must be in the kidney tubule.  A second \\nopinion is a good idea because there are better(less damaging) ways to break \\nup the stone if it\\'s logged within the kidney(sonic blasts).

Fordham von Reyn et al. of the \\nDartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon, N.H.  The researchers contacted \\n2,317 former patients on whom an HIV-positive orthopedic surgeon performed \\ninvasive  procedures between January 1, 1978 and June 30, 1992.  The  \\northopedic surgeon voluntarily withdrew from practice after  testing positive \\nfor HIV.  A total of 1,174 former patients  underwent HIV testing, \\nrepresenting 50.7 percent of patients on  whom the orthopedic surgeon \\nperformed invasive procedures during  the 13.5-year period.  Patients were \\ntested from each year and  from each category of invasive procedure.  All \\npatients were  found to be negative for HIV by enzyme-linked-immunosorbent  \\nassay.  Two former patients reported known HIV infection prior to surgery.  \\nThe examination of AIDS case registries and vital  records neglected to detect \\ncases of HIV infection among former  surgical patients.  The estimated cost of \\nthe initial patient  notification and testing was $158,000, with the single \\nmost  expensive activity being counseling and testing.  This accounted  for 37 \\npercent of the total expense.  The patient notification  and testing were \\nconducted while maintaining the confidentiality  of the orthopedic surgeon who \\nwas an active participant in the  planning and execution of the study.  \\nNotifying patients of the  infected surgeon\\'s HIV-status is both disruptive \\nand expensive  and is not routinely recommended, the researchers conclude. \\\\ \\n       =================================================================     \\n\"Investigation of Potential HIV Transmission to the Patients of  an HIV-\\nInfected Surgeon\" Journal of the American Medical Association (04/14/93) Vol. \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 38\\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\\n\\n269,  No. 14, P. 1795  (Smith Rogers, Audrey et al.) \\n\\n     The risk of HIV transmission during surgery is so remote that it  will be \\nquantified only by gathering data from multiple,  methodologically similar \\ninvestigations, writes Audrey Smith  Rogers et al. of the Johns Hopkins \\nUniversity School of Medicine  in Baltimore, Md.  The researchers identified a \\ntotal of 1,131  persons in hospital databases who underwent invasive surgical  \\nprocedures between 1984 and 1990 and for whom the HIV-positive  surgeon was \\nlisted as the operating surgeon.  The AIDS case  registries were reviewed for \\nall patients having undergone  invasive procedures and death certificates were \\nobtained.  Among  the 1,131 patients, 101 were dead, 119 had no address, 413 \\nhad  test results known, and 498 did not respond to the questionnaire. No \\nstudy patient name was found in reported AIDS case registries. One newly \\ndetected, HIV-positive patient was determined to have  been most probably \\ninfected in 1985 during a transfusion.  There  was no HIV transmission in 369 \\nperson-hours of surgical exposure, suggesting that HIV transmission to \\npatients is unlikely to occur more frequently than once per 1000 person-hours \\nof surgical  exposure.  The researchers determined there is no evidence to  \\nsuggest that the surgeon failed to adhere to standard  infection-control \\nguidelines; over 50 percent of the patients  with invasive procedures chose to \\nbe tested, and of those whose  results were revealed, only one person was \\nfound to be infected  with HIV.  The study patient\\'s infection was probably \\nthe result  of a tainted blood transfusion received in 1985.  As a result,  \\nthere is no evidence that the transmission of HIV from the  HIV-positive \\nsurgeon to any patient transpired, the researchers  conclude. \\n      ==================================================================\\n                                April 20, 1993 \\n      ==================================================================\\n \"Drug Concerns to Share AIDS Data\" New York Times (04/20/93), P. C10  \\n(Kolata, Gina) \\n\\n     A total of 15 major pharmaceutical companies have decided, in a  highly \\nunusual move, to share AIDS drugs and information while  the drugs are \\nundergoing early clinical testing.  Dr. Edward  Scolnick, president of the \\nMerck Research Laboratory in Rahway,  N.J., arranged the collaboration.  He \\nsaid that cooperation  between companies seemed increasingly significant as it \\nhad  become clear that combinations of drugs were likely to be more  effective \\nin fighting HIV than any drug used alone.  The  researchers are hopeful that \\nHIV, when faced with a combination  of several drugs requiring mutation at \\ndifferent sites for  resistance to develop, will be unable to evolve all the \\nmutations at the same time.  Therefore, several drugs taken together or one \\nafter the other could halt the spread of HIV.  Currently, the  drug companies \\ndo not know what other drugs their competitors are developing.  The new \\nagreement allows companies to routinely  exchange animal data and safety data \\non new AIDS drugs.  \"An  agreement like this will greatly facilitate \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 39\\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\\n\\ncompanies\\' ability to choose the best drug combinations much faster and in a \\nmuch more  efficient way,\" said Scolnick.  He also said that the  \\ncollaboration would not violate antitrust laws.  In creating the  agreement, \\nMerck spoke frequently to members of AIDS advocacy  groups, including ACT-UP.  \\nDr. Daniel Hoth, director of the  division on AIDS at the National Institute \\nof Allergy and  Infectious Disease said, \"We\\'re delighted to see the  \\npharmaceutical industry take this step because we think that  increasing the \\ninformation flow will likely accelerate the  discovery of better compounds for \\nAIDS.\"  Related Stories: Wall Street Journal (04/20) P.

However, a report in the Lancet demonstrated that AZT should \\nnot be used early in the course of disease.  While the CD4 counts of the 877 \\npeople given AZT were consistently greater  than those of patients receiving \\nonly placebo, the first three  years of follow-up have shown that the \\nproportions of people in  the two groups progressing to overt AIDS or even to \\ndeath were  not significantly different at roughly 18 percent.  The  \\nconclusions are that AZT is not an effective AIDS drug in  HIV-infected \\nindividuals, and that CD4 cell count may not be a  reliable proxy for the \\nprogression to AIDS in infected people.   But nothing is implied by the study \\nof the utility of AZT in the  treatment of those in whom symptoms have already \\nappeared--there  is no case for abandoning that treatment, at least on the  \\nevidence now available.  It is much more alarming that the CD4  count has \\nproven to be an unreliable mark of the efficacy of drug treatment in HIV \\ninfection.  AIDS researchers should acknowledge  HIV is alive from the \\nbeginning of infection and turn it into a  workable assay of the progress of \\ndisease.  The general  application of such an assay will probably in itself \\nprovide a  better understanding of the pathogenesis of AIDS, concludes  \\nMaddox. \\n      ================================================================== \\n\"Infective and Anti-Infective Properties of Breastmilk From  HIV-1-Infected \\nWomen\" Lancet (04/10/93) Vol. 341, No. 8850, P. 914   (Van de Perre, Philippe \\net al.) \\n\\n     A vaccine preparation inducing a persistent immune response of  the IgM \\ntype in the mother\\'s body fluids could be valuable to  prevent transmission of \\nHIV-1 from mother to child, write  Philippe Van de Perre et al. of the \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 40\\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\\n\\nNational AIDS Control Program in Kigali, Rwanda.  The researchers hypothesized \\nthat  transmission of HIV-1 through breastmilk could be favored by the  \\npresence of infected cells, by deficiency of anti-infective  substances in \\nbreastmilk, or both factors.  A total of 215  HIV-1-infected women were \\nenrolled at delivery in Kigali, Rwanda; milk samples were collected 15 days, 6 \\nmonths, and 18 months post partum.  HIV-1 IgG, secretory IgA, and IgM were \\nassayed by  western blot, for the latter two after removal of IgG with  \\nprotein G.  In the 15-day and 6-month samples, the researchers  sought viral \\ngenome in milk cells by double polymerase chain  reaction with three sets of \\nprimers (gag, pol, and env).  At 15  days, 6 months, and 18 months post \\npartum, HIV-1 specific IgG was detected in 95 percent, 98 percent, and 97 \\npercent of breastmilk  samples; IgA in 23 percent, 28 percent, and 41 percent; \\nand IgM  in 66 percent, 78 percent, and 41 percent.  In children who  survived \\nlonger than 18 months the risk of infection was  associated with lack of \\npersistence of IgM and IgA in their  mothers\\' milk.  The presence of HIV-1-\\ninfected cells in the milk  15 days post partum was strongly predictive of \\nHIV-1 infection in the child by both univariate and multivariate analysis.  \\nThe  combination of HIV-1 infected cells in breastmilk and a defective IgM \\nresponse was the strongest predictor of infection.  IgM and  IgA anti-HIV-1 in \\nbreastmilk may protect against postnatal  transmission of HIV, the researchers \\nconclude. \\n      ==================================================================    \\n                                April 21, 1993 \\n      ==================================================================    \\n\"Firms to Share AIDS Research in Global Venture\" Journal of Commerce \\n(04/21/93), P. 7A \\n\\n     A total of fifteen U.S. and European pharmaceutical companies  announced \\nTuesday they will swap drug supplies and information on early-stage AIDS \\nresearch to hasten the search for combination  therapies to fight HIV \\ninfection and AIDS.  The companies said  the unusual move resulted primarily \\nfrom the increasing  concentration of AIDS research on combination therapies \\nsince  realizing that HIV is likely to develop resistance to every  individual \\nAIDS drug.  Edward Scolnick, president of Merck & Co.  Research Laboratories, \\nled the collaborative effort that took a  year of negotiations to come \\ntogether, said participants.  In  addition to Merck, the other companies \\ninvolved in the  Inter-Company Collaboration for AIDS Drug Development are  \\nBristol-Myers Squibb Co., Burroughs Wellcome, Glaxo Inc.,  Hoffman-La Roche, \\nEli Lilly & Co., Pfizer Inc., Smithkline  Beecham, AB Astra, Du Pont Merck, \\nSyntex Inc., Boehringer  Ingelheim, Miles Inc., and Sigma-Tau.  The \\nparticipants said that all companies involved in AIDS drug development they \\nwere aware  of had joined the collaboration, and that any company actively  \\ninvolved in HIV anti-viral development may participate.

       " '\\n\\n\"Assuming\"? Also: come on, Brad. If we are going to get anywhere in \\nthis (or any) discussion, it doesn\\'t help to bring up elements I never \\naddressed, *nor commented on in any way*. I made no comment on who is \\n\"right\" or who is \"wrong\", only that civilians ARE being used as cover \\nand that, having been placed \"in between\" the Israelis and the guerillas,\\nthey *will* be injured as both parties continue their fight.\\n \\n\\t[The *purpose* of an army\\'s use of military uniforms \\n\\tis *to set its members apart* from the civilians so that \\n\\tcivilians will not be thought of by the other side as\\n\\t\"combatants\". So, what do you think is the \"meaning behind\", \\n\\tthe intention and the effect when an \"army\" purposely \\n\\t*does not were uniforms but goes out of its way to *look \\n\\tlike civilians\\'? *They are judging that the benefit they will \\n\\treceive from this \"cover\" is more important that the harm\\n\\tthat will come to civilians.*\\n\\nThis is a comment on the Israeli experience and is saying\\nthat the guerillas *do* have some responsibility in putting civilians\\nin \"the middle\" of this fight. By putting on uniforms and living apart\\nfrom civilians (barracks, etc.), the guerillas would significantly lower\\nthe risk to civilians.\\n\\n\\tBut if the guerillas do this aren\\'t *they* putting themselves\\n\\tat greater risk? Absolutely, they ask themselves \"why set \\n\\tourselves apart (by wearing uniforms) when there is a ready-made \\n\\tcover for us (civilians)? That makes sense from their point of \\n\\tview, BUT when this cover is used, the guerillas should accept \\n\\tsome of the responsibility for subsequent harm to civilians.\\n\\n\\nI agree with you here. I have always thought that Israel\\'s bombing\\nsortees and bombing policy is stupid, thoughtless, inhumane AND\\nineffective. BUT, there is no reason that Israel should passive wait \\nuntil attackers chose to act; there is every reason to believe that\\n\"taking the fight *to* the enemy\" will do more to stop attacks. \\n\\nAs I said previously, Israel spent several decades \"sitting passively\"\\non its side of a border and only acting to stop these attacks *after*\\nthe attackers had entered Israeli territory. It didn\\'t work very well.\\nThe \"host\" Arab state did little/nothing to try and stop these attacks \\nfrom its side of the border with Israel so the number of attacks\\nwere considerably higher, as was their physical and psychological impact \\non the civilians caught in their path.  \\n\\nThis is just another \"selectively applied\" statement.\\n \\nThe reason for this drawn-out impasse between Ababs/Palestinians and Israelis\\nis that NEITHER side is willing to accept the Word of the other. By your\\ncriteria *everyone* should stay away from the negotiations.\\n\\nThat is precisely why the Palestinians (in their recent PISGA proposal for \\nthe \"interim\" period after negotiations and leading up to full autonomy) are\\ndemanding conditions that essentially define \"autonomy\" already. They DO\\nNOT trust that Israel will \"follow through\" the entire process and allow\\nPalestinians to reach full autonomy. \\n\\nDo you understand and accept this viewpoint by the Palestinians? \\nIf you do, then why should Israel\\'s view of Arabs/Palestinians \\nbe any different? Why should they trust the Arab/Palestinians\\' words?\\nSince they don\\'t, they are VERY reluctant to give up \"tangible assets \\n(land, control of areas) in exchange for \"words\". For this reason,\\nthey are also concerned about the sorts of \"guarantees\" they will have \\nthat the Arabs WILL follow through on their part of any agreement reached.\\n\\nAbsolutely, so are the Arabs/Palestinians asking FIRST for the\\nIsraelis \"word\" in relation to any agreement? NO, what is being\\ndemanded FIRST is LAND. When the issue is LAND, and one party\\nfinally gets HOLD of this \"land\", what the \"other party\" does\\nis totally irrelevent. If I NOW have possession of this land,\\nyour words have absolutely no power; whether Israel chooses to\\nkeeps its word does NOT get the land back.\\n\\n\\nWhile the \"major armaments\" (those allowing people to wage \"civil wars\")\\nhave been removed, the weapons needed to cross-border attacks still\\nremain to some extent. Rocket attacks still continue, and \"commando\"\\nraids only require a few easily concealed weapons and a refined disregard\\nfor human life (yours of that of others). Such attacks also continue.\\n\\n\\nBat guano. The situation you call for existed in the 1970s and attacks\\nwere commonplace.\\n\\n\\nThere is NO WAY these groups can be effectively \"disarmed\" UNLESS the state\\nis as authoritarian is Syria\\'s. The only other way is for Lebanon to take\\nit upon itself to constantly patrol the entire border with Israel, essentially\\nmirroring Israel\\'s border secirity on its side. It HAS TO PROVE TO ISREAL that\\nit is this committed to protecting Israel from attack from Lebanese territory.\\n\\nThat\\'s what I said, ok? But, doesn\\'t that mean that Syria has to \"take over\"\\nLebanon? I don\\'t think Israel or Lebanon would like that.\\nWhat both \"sides\" need is to receive something \"tangible\". The Arabs/\\nPalestinians are looking for \"land\" and demanding that they receive it\\nprior to giving anything to Israel. Israel has two problems: 1) if it\\ngives up real *land* it IS exposing itself to a changed geostrategic\\nsituation (and that change doesn\\'t help Israel\\'s position), and 2) WHEN\\nit gives up this land IT NEEDS to receive something in return to\\ncompensate for the increased risks',\n",
       " \"\\nI have the same problem.  I have looked at Motif++, WWL, InterViews, GINA++,\\nand a few variations on the above.  I've also done a cursory examination\\nof Rogue Wave's View.h++.  I like View.h++'s abstractions best of all of the\\ntoolkits I mentioned, but the resulting code looks little like Motif, and I\\nhave little confidence that this software will catch on or otherwise result\\nin significant longevity for my code.  GINA++ allows you to write code which\\nlooks a great deal like Motif and also makes interesting use of inheritance,\\nbut the resulting code is almost too Motif-like, and is certainly not\\nsignificantly less verbose than equivalent C code.

       " '\\n\\nActually, just after the FIRST world war, many Muslims were killed by Serbs.\\nUnder Serbian-led regime between the two world wars, many Croats were\\nalso killed (especially during the dictatorship introduced on Jan. 6, 1929).\\nSome Croats formed a resistance movement \"Ustashas\" (Insurgents) and\\nwere forced into exile, to fascist Italy, which sheltered them.  In exile,\\nthey practiced a terrorist approach to liberating Croatia; while Croats in\\nCroatia followed the approach of peaceful negotiations under the leadership\\nof Vladko Macek.  After the Axis powers took control in the SECOND world\\nwar, Vladko Macek refused to collaborate, so Ustashas were brought in \\nto run the newly formed puppet state.  This state included both Croatia and\\nBosnia-Herzegovina, and its ideology saw Muslims as the best Croats\\n(\"flowers of Croatian people\").  Some Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina\\ntherefore joined Ustashas.  However, even more others did not; they\\njoined Tito\\'s Partisans.    The Ustashas membership peaked at \\nless than 1% of Croat and Muslim population of that area at that time.\\n\\nAfter WWII, Muslims were still considered a religious minority descended\\nfrom Croats or Serbs who converted to Islam centuries ago.  But, in 1968,\\nit was decided that forcing Muslims to declare their nationality as\\neither Serbs or Croats is not a good policy.  Dobrica Cosic, the current\\npresident of the rump Yugoslavia, was strongly opposed, and sought to\\nprevent the category \"Muslim\" (in an ethnic sense) from appearing on the\\nnext census.  He was criticized and expelled from the party.  So, since\\nthat time, Bosnian Muslims are considered a separate nationality, although\\nsome still deny this and insist that they choose either Serb or Croat\\nnationality.',\n",

A physician who continued to use it, when better, more effective, \\ntreatments are available, may deserve to be called a quack.  Anti-fungals \\nare in a different class.  The big question seems to be is it reasonable to \\nuse them in patients with GI distress or sinus problems that *could* be due \\nto candida blooms following the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics?  Gorden \\nRubenfeld, through e-mail, has assured me that most physicians recognize \\nthe chance of candida blooms occuring after broad-spectrum antibiotic use \\nand they therefore reinnoculate their patients with *good* bacteria to \\nrestore competetion for candida in the body.  I do not believe that this is \\nyet a standard part of medical practice.

The arguement is that without proof, no action is \\nwarrented.\\n\\nMedicine has not, and probalby never will be, practiced this way.  There \\nhas always been the use of conventional wisdom.  A very good example is \\nkidney stones.  Conventional wisdom(because clinical trails have not been \\ndone to come up with an effective prevention), was that restricitng the \\nintake of calcium and oxalates was the best way to prevent kidney stones \\nfrom forming.  Clinical trials focused on drugs or ultrasonic blasts to \\nbreakdown the stone once it formed.  Through the recent New England J of \\nMedicine article, we now know that conventional wisdom was wrong, \\nincreasing calcium intake is better at preventing stone formation than is \\nrestricting calcium intake.\\n\\nThe conventional wisdom in animal husbandry has been that animals need to \\nbe reinnoculated with *good* bacteria after coming off antibiotic therapy.\\nIf it makes sense for livestock, why doesn't it make sense for humans \\nDavid?  We are not talking about a dangerous treatment(unless you consider \\nyogurt dangerous).

It\\nwould facilitate the peaceful integration of Israel into the Middle-east\\nand constitute the best guarantee for permanent Jewish presence -\\nin the area.

A genocide of Armenians took place\\nduring peacetime.\\n\\nAnd it was a great tragedy for me personally, because I lost my father in\\nthose days. He was still young. Born in 1926.\\n\\nOn that day, February 28, we were at home. Of course we had heard that there \\nwas unrest in town, my younger brother Aleksandr had told us about it. But we \\ndidn\\'t think . . . we thought that everything would happen outdoors, that they\\nwouldn\\'t go into people\\'s apartments. About five o\\'clock we saw a large crowd \\nnear the Kosmos movie theater in our microdistrict. We were sitting at home \\nwatching television. We go out on the balcony and see the crowd pour into Mir \\nStreet. This is right near downtown, next to the airline ticket office, our \\nhouse is right nearby. That day there was a group of policeman with shields\\nthere. They threw rocks at those policemen. Then they moved off in the \\ndirection of our building. They burned a motorcycle in our courtyard and \\nstarted shouting for Armenians to come out of the building. We switched off \\nthe light. As it turns out, their signal was just the opposite: to turn on the\\nlight. That meant that it was an Azerbaijani home. We, of course, didn\\'t know \\nand thought that if they saw lights on they would come to our apartment.\\n\\nSuddenly there\\'s pounding on the door. We go to the door, all four of us:\\nthere were four of us in the apartment. Father, Mother, my younger brother\\nAleksandr, and I. He was born in 1959. My father was a veteran of World War \\nII and had fought in China and in the Soviet Far East; he was a pilot.\\n\\nWe went to the door and they started pounding on it harder, breaking it down \\nwith axes. We start to talk to them in Azerbaijani, \"What\\'s going on? What\\'s \\nhappened?\" They say, \"Armenians, get out of here!\" We don\\'t open the door, we \\nsay, \"If we have to leave, we\\'ll leave, we\\'ll leave tomorrow.\" They say, \"No, \\nleave now, get out of here, Armenian dogs, get out of here!\" By now they\\'ve \\nbroken the door both on the lock and the hinge sides. We hold them off as best\\nwe can, my father and I on one side, and my mother and brother on the other. \\nWe had prepared ourselves: we had several hammers and an axe in the apartment,\\nand grabbed what we could find to defend ourselves. They broke in the door and\\nwhen the door gave way, we held it for another half-hour. No neighbors, no\\npolice and no one from the city government came to our aid the whole time. We \\nheld the door. They started to smash the door on the lock side, first with an \\naxe, and then with a crowbar.\\n\\nWhen the door gave way--they tore it off its hinges--Sasha hit one of them \\nwith the axe. The axe flew out of his hands. They also had axes, crowbars, \\npipes, and special rods made from armature shafts. One of them hit my father \\nin the head. The pressure from the mob was immense. When we retreated into the\\nroom, one of them hit my mother, too, in the left part of her face. My brother\\nSasha and I fought back, of course. Sasha is quite strong and hot-tempered, he\\nwas the judo champion of Sumgait. We had hammers in our hands, and we injured \\nseveral of the bandits--in the heads and in the eyes, all that went on. But \\nthey, the injured ones, fell back, and others came to take their places, there\\nwere many of them.\\n\\nThe door fell down at an angle. The mob tried to remove the door, so as to go \\ninto the second room and to continue . . . to finish us off. Father brought \\nskewers and gave them to Sasha and me--we flew at them when we saw Father \\nbleeding: his face was covered with blood, he had been wounded in the head, \\nand his whole face was bloody. We just threw ourselves on them when we saw \\nthat. We threw ourselves at the mob and drove back the ones in the hall, drove\\nthem down to the third floor. We came out on the landing, but a group of the \\nbandits remained in one of the rooms they were smashing all the furniture in \\nthere, having closed the door behind them. We started tearing the door off to \\nchase away the remaining ones or finish them. Then a man, an imposing man of \\nabout 40, an Azerbaijani, came in. When he was coming in, Father fell down and\\nMother flew to him, and started to cry out. I jumped out onto the balcony and \\nstarted calling an ambulance, but then the mob started throwing stones through\\nthe windows of our veranda and kitchen. We live on the fourth floor. And no \\none came. I went into the room. It seemed to me that this man was the leader \\nof the group. He was respectably dressed in a hat and a trench coat with a \\nfur collar. And he addressed my mother in Azerbaijani: \"What\\'s with you, \\nwoman, why are you shouting? What happened? Why are you shouting like that?\"\\nShe says, \"What do you mean, what happened? You killed somebody!\" My father \\nwas a musician, he played the clarinet, he played at many weddings, Armenian \\nand Azerbaijani, he played for many years. Everyone knew him. Mother says, \\n\"The person who you killed played at thousands of Azerbaijani weddings, he \\nbrought so much joy to people, and you killed that person.\" He says, \"You \\ndon\\'t need to shout, stop shouting.\" And when they heard the voice of this \\nman, the 15 to 18 people who were in the other room opened the door and \\nstarted running out. We chased after them, but they ran away. That man left, \\ntoo. As we were later told, downstairs one of them told the others, I don\\'t \\nknow if it was from fright or what, told them that we had firearms, even\\nthough we only fought with hammers and an axe. We raced to Father and started \\nto massage his heart, but it was already too late. We asked the neighbors to \\ncall an ambulance. The ambulance never came, although we waited for it all \\nevening and all through the night.\\n\\nSomewhere around midnight about 15 policemen came. They informed us they were \\nfrom Khachmas. They said, \"We heard that a group was here at your place, you \\nhave our condolences.\" They told us not to touch anything and left. Father lay\\nin the room.\\n\\nSo we stayed home. Each of us took a hammer and a knife. We sat at home. Well,\\nwe say, if they descend on us again we\\'ll defend ourselves. Somewhere around \\none o\\'clock in the morning two people came from the Sumgait Procuracy, \\ninvestigators. They say, \"Leave everything just how it is, we\\'re coming back \\nhere soon and will bring an expert who will record and photograph everything.\"\\nThen people came from the Republic Procuracy too, but no one helped us take \\nFather away. The morning came and the neighbors arrived. We wanted to take \\nFather away somehow. We called the Procuracy and the police a couple of times,\\nbut no one came. We called an ambulance, and nobody came. Then one of the \\nneighbors said that the bandits were coming to our place again and we should \\nhide. We secured the door somehow or other. We left Father in the room and \\nwent up to the neighbor\\'s.\\n\\nThe excesses began again in the morning. The bandits came in several vehicles,\\nZIL panel trucks, and threw themselves out of the vehicles like . . . a \\nlanding force near the center of town. Our building was located right there. A\\ncrowd formed. Then they started fighting with the soldiers. Then, in Buildings\\n19 and 20, that\\'s next to the airline ticket office, they started breaking \\ninto Armenian apartments, destroying property, and stealing. The Armenians \\nweren\\'t at home, they had managed to flee and hide somewhere. And again they \\npoured in the direction of our building. They were shouting that there were \\nsome Armenians left on the fourth floor, meaning us. \"They\\'re up there, still,\\nup there. Let\\'s go kill them!\" They broke up all the furniture remaining in \\nthe two rooms, threw it outside, and burned it in large fires. We were hiding \\none floor up. Something heavy fell. Sasha threw himself toward the door \\nshouting that it was probably Father, they had thrown Father, were defiling \\nthe corpse, probably throwing it in the fire, going to burn it. I heard it, \\nand the sound was kind of hollow, and I said, \"No, that\\'s from some of the \\nfurniture.\" Mother and I pounced on Sasha and stopped him somehow, and calmed \\nhim down.\\n\\nThe mob left somewhere around eight o\\'clock. They smashed open the door and \\nwent into the apartment of the neighbors across from us. They were also\\nArmenians, they had left for another city.\\n\\nThe father of the neighbor who was concealing us came and said, \"Are you \\ncrazy? Why are you hiding Armenians? Don\\'t you now they\\'re checking all the \\napartments? They could kill you and them!\" And to us :\" . . . Come on, leave \\nthis apartment!\" We went down to the third floor, to some other neighbors\\'. At\\nfirst the man didn\\'t want to let us in, but then one of his sons asked him and\\nhe relented. We stayed there until eleven o\\'clock at night. We heard the sound\\nof motors. The neighbors said that it was armored personnel carriers. We went \\ndownstairs. There was a light on in the room where we left Father. In the \\nother rooms, as we found out later, all the chandeliers had been torn down. \\nThey left only one bulb. The bulb was burning, which probably was a signal \\nthey had agreed on because there was a light burning in every apartment in our\\nMicrodistrict 3 where there had been a pogrom.\\n\\nWith the help of the soldiers we made it to the City Party Committee and were \\nsaved. Our salvation--my mother\\'s, my brother\\'s, and mine,--was purely \\naccidental, because, as we later found out from the neighbors, someone in the \\ncrowd shouted that we had firearms up there. Well, we fought, but we were only\\nable to save Mother. We couldn\\'t save Father. We inflicted many injuries on \\nthe bandits, some of them serious. But others came to take their places. We \\nwere also wounded, there was blood, and we were scratched all over--we got our\\nshare. It was a miracle we survived. We were saved by a miracle and the \\ntroops. And if troops hadn\\'t come to Sumgait, the slaughter would have been \\neven greater: probably all the Armenians would have been victims of the \\ngenocide.\\n\\nThrough an acquaintance at the City Party Committee I was able to contact the \\nleadership of the military unit that was brought into the city, and at their \\norders we were assigned special people to accompany us, experts. We went to \\'\\npick up Father\\'s corpse. We took it to the morgue. This was about two o\\'clock \\nin the morning, it was already March 1, it was raining very hard and it was \\nquite cold, and we were wearing only our suits. When my brother and I carried \\nFather into the morgue we saw the burned and disfigured corpses. There were \\nabout six burned people in there, and the small corpse of a burned child. It \\nwas gruesome. I suffered a tremendous shock. There were about ten people \\nthere, but the doctor on duty said that because of the numbers they were being\\ntaken to Baku. There was a woman\\'s corpse there too, she had been . . . well, \\nthere was part of a body there . . . a hacked-off part of a woman\\'s body. It \\nwas something terrible. The morgue was guarded by the landing force . . . The \\nchild that had been killed was only ten or twelve years old. It was impossible\\nto tell if it was a boy or a girl because the corpse was burned. There was a \\nman there, too, several men. You couldn\\'t tell anything because their faces \\nwere disfigured, they were in such awful condition...\\n\\nNow two and a half months have passed. Every day I recall with horror what \\nhappened in the city of Sumgait. Every day: my father, and the death of my \\nfather, and how we fought, and the people\\'s sorrow, and especially the morgue.\\n\\nI still want to say that 70 years have passed since Soviet power was\\nestablished, and up to the very last minute we could not conceive of what \\nhappened  in Sumgait. It will go down in history.\\n\\nI\\'m particularly surprised that the mob wasn\\'t even afraid of the troops. They\\neven fought the soldiers. Many soldiers were wounded. The mob threw fuel \\nmixtures onto the armored personnel carriers, setting them on fire. They \\nweren\\'t afraid. They were so sure of their impunity that they attacked our \\ntroops. I saw the clashes on February 29 near the airline ticket office, right\\nacross from our building. And that mob was fighting with the soldiers. The \\ninhabitants of some of the buildings, also Azerbaijanis, threw rocks at the \\nsoldiers from windows, balconies, even cinder blocks and glass tanks. They \\nweren\\'t afraid of them. I say they were sure of their impunity. When we were \\nat the neighbors\\' and when they were robbing homes near the airline ticket \\noffice I called the police at number 3-20-02 and said that they were robbing \\nArmenian apartments and burning homes. And they told me that they knew that \\nthey were being burned. During those days no one from the police department \\ncame to anyone\\'s aid. No one came to help us, either, to our home, even though\\nperhaps they could have come and saved us.\\n\\nAs we later found out the mob was given free vodka and drugs, near the bus \\nstation. Rocks were distributed in all parts of town to be thrown and used in \\nfighting. So I think all of it was arranged in advance. They even knew in \\nwhich buildings and apartments the Armenians lived, on which floors--they had\\nlists, the bandits. You can tell that the \"operation\" was  planned in advance.\\n\\nThanks, of course, to our troops, to the country\\'s leadership, and to the\\nleadership of the Ministry of Defense for helping us, thanks to the Russian\\npeople, because the majority of the troops were Russians, and the troops \\nsuffered losses, too. I want to express this gratitude in the name of my \\nfamily and in the name of all Armenians, and in the name of all Sumgait\\nArmenians. For coming in time and averting terrible things: worse would\\nhave happened if that mob had not been stopped on time.\\n\\nAt present an investigation is being conducted on the part of the USSR\\nProcuracy. I want to say that those bandits should receive the severest\\npossible punishment, because if they don\\'t, the tragedy, the genocide, could \\nhappen again. Everyone should see that the most severe punishment is meted\\nout for such deeds.\\n\\nVery many bandits and hardened hooligans took part in the unrest, in the mass \\ndisturbances. The mobs were huge. At present not all of them have been caught,\\nvery few of them have been, I think, judging by the newspaper reports. There \\nwere around 80 people near our building alone, that\\'s how many people took \\npart in the pogrom of our building all in all.\\n\\nThey should all receive the most severe punishment so that others see that \\nretribution awaits those who perform such acts.\\n\\n   May 18, 1988\\n   Yerevan\\n\\n\\t\\t     - - - reference - - -\\n\\n[1] _The Sumgait Tragedy; Pogroms against Armenians in Soviet Azerbaijan,\\n    Volume I, Eyewitness Accounts_, edited by Samuel Shahmuradian, forward by\\n    Yelena Bonner, 1990, published by Aristide D.

In my\\nencounters with Christians, I find myself dismayed by their\\nbelief that their faith is total truth.  According to them,\\ntheir beliefs come from the Bible and the bible is the word of\\nGod and God is truth - thus they know the truth.  This stance\\nmakes it difficult to discuss other faiths with them and my own\\nhesitations about Christianity because they see no other way.\\nTheir way is the \\'truth.\\'\\n\\nBut I see their faith arising from a willful choice to believe\\na particular way.  That choice is part faith and part reason,\\nbut it seems to me a choice.\\n\\nMy discussions with some Christians remind me of schoolyard\\ndiscussions when I was in grade school:\\n\\nA kid would say, \"All policemen are jerks!\"  I\\'d ask, \"How do\\nyou know?\"  \"Because my daddy told me so!\"  \"How do you know\\nyou\\'re daddy is right?\"  \"He says he\\'s always right!\"\\n\\nWell the argument usually stops right there.  In the end,\\naren\\'t we all just kids, groping for the truth?  If so, do we have\\nthe authority to declare all other beliefs besides our own as\\nfalse?\\n\\n-------------\\n\\nThis is only my third time browsing through this newsgroup.  I\\napologize if I\\'m covering tired old ground.  Some of the\\ndiscussions on this topic have piqued my interest and I welcome\\nany comments.\\n\\n-- \\n\\n[I\\'m sort of mystified about how a Christian might respond to this.  I\\ncan understand criticisms of Christianity that say there\\'s not enough\\nevidence to believe it, or that there\\'s just as good evidence for\\nother religions.  I don\\'t agree, but clearly there are plenty of\\nintelligent people who don\\'t find the evidence convincing.  But that\\ndoesn\\'t seem to be your point.  Rather, you seem upset that people who\\nbelieve Christianity is true also believe that things which contradict\\nit are false.\\n\\nThis suggests a model of spiritual things that\\'s rather different than\\nthe Christian one.  It sounds more like an existentialist view, where\\npeople choose what value to follow, but there\\'s no actual independent\\nspiritual reality, and so no way to say that a specific choice is in\\nsome unique sense right.  This sort of model -- with modifications of\\none sort or another -- may be appropriate for some religions.  But\\nChristianity is in its essense a \"historical\" religion.  That is, it\\'s\\nbased on the concept that there are actual spiritual entities out\\nthere, that one of them has intervened in history in specific ways,\\nand that we see evidence of that in history.  In the \"mundane\" world,\\nwe are not free to choose how things work.  When we drop something, it\\nfalls (aside from well-defined situations where it doesn\\'t).  The\\nChristian concept is that spiritual matters, there is also an actual\\nexternal reality.  I hope we\\'re all honest enough not to claim that we\\nhave perfect understanding.  But while we may not think we know\\neverything, we are confident that we know some things.  And that\\nimplies that we think things that contradict them are false.  I don\\'t\\nsee how else we could proceed.\\n\\nThis needn\\'t result in arrogance.  I\\'m certainly interested in talking\\nwith people of other religions.  They may have things to teach me, and\\neven if they don\\'t, I respect them as fellow human beings.  But it\\'s\\ngot to be possible to respect people and also think that on some\\nmatters they are wrong.  Maybe even disasterously wrong.',\n",

Is there any data on\\nhome care vs. day care?\\n\\n-- Does being sick \"build immunity\" (leading to less illness later),\\ndoes it make kids \"weaker\" (leading to more illness later), or does it\\nnot have any long term effect?\\n\\n-- Does taking antibiotics on a regular basis have any negative long\\nterm effects?\\n\\n-- How does one tell if a child is more susceptible to illness than\\nnormal, and what does one do about it?\\n\\n-- Is there any way to build immunity and resistance?\\n\\nAny data, information or advice relating to this would be much\\nappreciated.

       " 'I\\'ve sent Gordon R. my posts on protein, vitamin C and vitamin A prior to \\nposting on internet as a professional courtesy.  Somehow I\\'ve managed to \\ndelete my vitamin A post from my text file.  Gordon R. had promised to send \\nit back to me but he\\'s pretty mad at me right now so I\\'ll just retype it.\\nSince digging through all my references is very time consuming(took me all \\nday for that PMS post), I\\'m not going to cite any references(Gordon R. has \\nthem).  I\\'m going to include some of the material from Weinsier and \\nMorgan\\'s new Nutrition textbook(which was not in my original material) to \\npoint out that what I\\'m going to say has some support in the medical \\ncommunity.\\n\\nDiet has been know to affect the immune system of man for a very, very long \\ntime.  Protein has always had the biggest role in infection and I\\'ve \\nalready covered the role of protein in protecting you against infection.\\nNow I\\'m going to hit what I consider to be the most important nutrient in \\nthe U.S. as far as infection is concerned(vitamin A).\\n\\nWhen vitamin A was originally discovered, it was commonly referred to as \\nthe anti-infection vitamin.  Many people(Linus Pauling being one) have \\ndecided to take this title away from vitamin A and give it to vitamin C\\n(which I\\'ve already covered).  Big mistake(in my opinion).  Vitamin A is \\nalso getting a reputation as an anti-cancer vitamin(with good reason).\\nThe NCI currently has numerous clinical trials in progress to see if \\nvitamin A can not only prevent cancer but cure it as well.  It\\'s role in \\nboth cancer and infection is almost identical(but not quite).\\n\\nVitamin A comes in two completely different forms(retinol and \\nbeta-carotene).  Retinol is the animal form and it\\'s toxic, beta-carotene \\nis the plant form and it\\'s completely nontoxic.  Both retinol and beta-\\ncarotene display good absorption in the human gut if bile is present\\n(60-80%).  The liver stores all of your retinol and doles it out for other \\ntissues to use by synthesizing retinol binding protein(RBP).  A normal human \\nadult liver should have 500,000IU to 1,000,000IU of retinol stored.  We \\nare born with 10,000IU in our liver.  U.S. autopsy has shown that about \\n30% of Americans die with the same(or less) amount of vitamin A as they \\nwere born with.  If you don\\'t believe that nutritional reserves(like that \\nof retinol in the liver) are important, then this low vitamin A reserve is \\nnot going to affect you.  But if you believe(like I do) that the nutrient \\nreserves are important, then there is a problem with vitamin A in the U.S.\\n\\nThe U.S. RDA for vitamin A in an adult male is 1,000 RE or 5,000IU of \\nvitamin A.  For adult feamles its 800 RE or 4,000IU of vitamin A.  Diet \\nsurveys show that most Americans are getting this amount of vitamin A\\n(either retinol or Beta-carotene) from their diet.  But the NRC(National \\nResearch Council) was going to release a new RDA table in 1985 that had the \\nRDA for both vitamin A and vitamin C raised(C to 90mg per day and A to \\n7,500IU per day for adult males).  That report and it\\'s recommendations was \\nkilled.  Why? Concern over the increasing supplementation was the main \\nreason.  RDAs are set to prevent clinical disease, not to keep nutrient \\nreserves full.  Many scientist in the U.S. feel that the time has come to \\nmove away from the prevention of clinical pathology concept and move \\ntowards the promotion of optimum health concept, especially since we have \\nsome very good data now that show that nutrient reserves are extremely \\nimportant during periods of stress.  The nutritonal concervatives won that \\nbattle and a new group of scientist were collected to come out with the \\n1989 RDA list which lowered the RDA for several nutrients and moved the \\ndietary guidelines back to where they were when we first started in the \\n1940\\'s(get enough to prevent clinical pathology, but not enough to fill \\nthe reserves).\\n\\nWe know from autopsy that only about 10% of Americans have a liver with a \\nnormal vitamin A reserve(500,000IU to 1,000,000IU).  I preach nutrient \\nreserves to my students and tell them to measure them in their patients.\\nBut for vitamin A, only a liver biopsy(or autopsy data) will tell you how \\nmuch somebody has stored.  We can tell very easily if someone has \\noverfilled his or her liver with vitamin A by measuring the serium retinol \\nlevel(levels above 450ug/dl are highly suggestive that you have filled your \\nliver with vitamin A and it\\'s time to stop taking retinol).  The normal \\nrange of serum retinol will be 20-100ug/dl.  Hypervitaminosis A is \\ndiagnosed with a serum retinol level of 2,000ug/dl or higher(Interpretation \\nof Diagnostic Test, Wallach, M.D., a Little Brown Series book).  This level \\nof vitamin A in blood means that medical attention is necessary due to \\nvitamin A toxicity.  Weinsier and Morgan take a much more conservative \\napproach to vitamin A toxicity than does Wallach, as you will see later in \\nthis post.  Between 450ug/dl and 2,000ug/dl you should have plenty \\nof warning that it\\'s time to eliminate the retinol from your diet(headache, \\nredness of the skin, hair loss, joint pain).\\n\\nI tell all my students that will use vitamin A in their practice that they \\nhad better monitor the serum retinol level and stop when there are clear \\nsigns that the liver is full.  You will never really know if the patient \\nneeds the vitamin A(because you can not measure the pool in liver) but you \\nwill always know when it\\'s time to stop(just like in those vitamin A for \\nPMS studies).\\n\\nBeta-carotene can be taken to fill up your liver with retinol and you will \\nnever have to worry about toxicity because the conversion of beta-carotene to \\nretinol that occurs in both your gut and your liver will slow down(stops in the \\nliver and slows down in the gut) when your liver is full of retinol.  But \\ntaking Beta-carotene as the source of retinol takes a very long time to \\nfill the liver up(I\\'ve seen estimates of 20-30 years) if you are in the 30% \\nthat only has as much as you were born with in your liver(10,000IU).  One \\nother problem with beta-carotene, if you have a zinc deficit, you will not \\nconvert as much beta-carotene to retinol in the gut or the liver because the \\nenxzyme that does this conversion requires zinc.  In addition, the release of \\nretinol from the liver is a zinc dependent process so a zinc deficit will \\ncause a vitamin A deficit even if your liver has plenty of vitamin A.\\n\\nNow what does vitamin A do in cancer and infection protection?  The body \\nuses vitamin A(retinol) for many different things.  Vision(the first to be \\nnailed down and where you see overt clinical pathology) uses the aldehyde\\n(retinal) and alcohol(retinol) form of vitamin A.  Reproduction uses the \\nretinol form  and some retinal.  Infection and cancer protection uses \\nretinoic acid.  How do you convert retinol(which your white blood cells \\nand the mucosal cells get from blood) to retinoic acid?  You use enzymes, \\none of which requires vitamin C(this is why Pauling has tried to pull the \\ntitle of anti-infection vitamin away from vitamin A).  Vitamin C does play \\na role in infection(interferon production for example) but it\\'s biggest role \\nis the conversion of retinol to retinoic acid.  If you increase your intake \\nof vitamin C, you will increase your formation of retinoic acid.  But \\nretinoic acid can not be converted back to retinol(as retinal can) and once \\nit\\'s formed, it\\'s used and then lost to the body.  This is why the 1985 NRC \\ngroup wanted to increase both vitamin C and vitamin A RDA\\'s.\\n\\nMost people taking large amounts of vitamin C really think that they are \\nhelping themselves.  If they don\\'t have much vitamin A in their liver and \\nthey are not also increasing their intake of vitamin A, they actually do \\nthemselves more harm than good.\\n\\nRetinoic acid functions in white blood cells to promote antibody formation.\\nIn the mucus membrane, it is the main factor in promoting good mucus \\nproduction and a good epithelial cell barrier to prevent infectious agents from \\nentering the blood system.  The mucus membrane is referred to as the \"first \\nline\" defense against infection.  For cancer, retinoic acid has been shown \\nto act as a cell brake(it counteracts the effect of cell promoters which \\nstimulate cells to divide).  Cancer has two distinct steps, DNA alteration \\nand cell promotion.  For cells that normally divide all the time, promoters \\nare not that important.  But for lung and breast tissue which does not \\nnormally divide, promoters are real important in the malignant process.\\nThis is the major reason why the NCI has so many different clinical trials \\nin progress using retinol and/or beta-carotene.\\n\\nChronic infection(irritation) of the mucus membranes is a signal that \\nvitamin A may not be adequate.  I tell my students that any patient who \\nwalks into their office with a complaint of chronic infection has to be \\nworked up for vitamin A(along with the other factors that medicine already \\nhas on it\\'s list of causes for chronic infection).  I drive this home in my \\ncourse at the Osteopathic College in Tulsa, when I teach at the allopathic \\nmedical school in Tulsa(OU\\'s branch campus) and when I give CME lectures.\\n\\nDark adaptation is the best clinical test for vitamin A status since night \\nvision is impacted when liver reverves drop to 50,000IU of retinol.  The \\nserum level of retinol can also be used, but it does not drop until liver \\nreserves drop below 10,000 to 20,000IU.  Asking a patient if they have \\ntrouble seeing at night is a good initial screen(if cataracts are ruled \\nout).  In one study done on U.S. Spanish-Americans where serum retinol levels \\nwere measured, 25% of the sample population had a serum retinol level below \\n20ug/dl.\\n\\nAs more studies are done on serum retinol levels in population groups of \\nthe U.S. that have had a history of high infection rates, we will probably \\nsee a much stonger correlation between infection incidence rates and low \\nserum retinol levels.\\n\\nWhat do Weinsier and Morgan have to say about vitamin A?  Here are excerpts\\nfrom their book:\\n\\nVitamin A functions in vision in the forrm of retinol, it is necessay for \\ngrowth and differentation of epithelial tissue, and is required for \\nreproduction, embryonic development, and bone growth.  Protein-calorie \\nmalnutrition and zinc deficiency may impair the absorption, transport, and \\nmetabolism of vitamin A.  Retinaldehyde is converted to retinoic acid, \\nwhich has biological activity in growth and in cell diferentiation but not \\nin reproduction or vision.  The most common procedure to evaluate vitamin A \\nstatus is to measure the retinol level in plasma or serum.  The normal \\nrange for vitamin A content for a child is 20 to 90ug/dl.  Lower values are \\nindicators of deficiency or depleted body stores.  Serum levels greater \\nthan 100ug/dl are indicative of toxic levels of vitamin A.  Dark adaptation \\ntests and electroretinogram measurements are also useful but difficult to \\nperform on young children.  Rapidly proliferating tissues are sensitive to \\nvitamin A deficiency and may revert to an undifferentiated state.  The \\nbronchorespiratory tract, skin, genitourinary system, gastrointestinal \\ntract and sweat glands are adversely affected.  A daily intake of more than \\n7.5mg(about 37,000IU) of retinol is not advised and chronic use of amounts \\nover 20mg(100,000IU) can result in a dry and itching skin, desquamation, \\nerythematous dermatitis, hair loss, joint pain, chapped lips, hyperostois\\n(bony depositis), headaches, anorexia, edema and fatigue.  \\n\\nThey recommend 30mg of retinol via IM injection in children for vitamin A \\ndeficiency but do not discuss treatment for adults.  Their toxic serum retinol \\nlevel is very conservative.  I recommend that my students try 25,000IU in \\nadults that are having problems with chronic infection.  They have to rule \\nout a zinc deficit first by getting an RBC zinc run(or if their clinical \\nlab can\\'t run it, I tell them to do what Weinsier and Morgan suggest, give \\nthem the zinc along with the vitamin A.  At 25,000IU per day, toxicity \\nshould not be a problem and you will not have to worry about pulling the \\npatient into the office on a regular basis to run a serum retinol.\\n\\nBoth Elaine and Jon found doctors who used a much higher dose of vitamin A.\\nRecall that the PMS papers were using 100,000IU to 200,000IU of vitamin A.\\nI don\\'t suggest that my students use these high doses.  If you wanted to \\nfill the liver up fast(as part of a clinical trial) and were monitoring the \\nserum retinol level, then you would be okay.  But my knowledge of the \\nvitamin A literature suggests to me that 25,000IU for patients with a \\ndemonstrated vitamin A deficit(dark adapatation test or serum retinol) will \\nprovide a good and steady improvement(as long as zinc and vitamin C status \\nare good) without having to worry about toxicity.  If they want to get more \\nagressive, fine if they follow my advise to check the serum retinol.  But \\nvitamin A(retinol) should never be given in high dose to women who could \\nbecome pregnant since vitamin A shows teratogenicity towards the human \\nfetus.  The dose needed to show this effect on the developing fetus is \\n18,000IU of retinol per day.  Beta-carotene will never have this effect on \\nthe human fetus.\\n\\nCould just taking Beta-carotene instead of retinol supplements help?  Yes \\nbut the effect will take a long time to develop.  My advise is to use \\nretinol to fill the liver up and then switch to beta-carotene to keep it \\nfull.  Vitamin A is probably one nutrient that is better off left to \\nprescription by doctors.  But when we have the M.D.\\'s in this newsgroup \\njumping all over me and other doctors that propose the use of vitamin A \\nsupplements for treating patients with chronic sinus and GI distress, I \\nthink that the most prudent option is to keep vitamin A in the OTC market \\nbut require manufactors to provide package inserts to educate the general \\npublic about the dangers of vitamin A supplementation.',\n",

I hope it helps:\\n\\n[Begin repeat of previous post]\\n\\nAs for the scripture mentioned I agree that it does seem to be a \\nproblem, not only for eternal marriage but marriage in general.  \\nLuke\\'s version has Jesus saying that the children of this world \\nmarry and are given in marriage but not those who will attain\\nthe kingdom of heaven.  It almost sounds like marriage disqualifies\\none for salvation.  (Matthew and Mark both omit this statement.)   I\\nthink the accounts are not as clear as they might be.  Let\\'s have a\\nlook at the incident and see if we can come up with some reasonable\\nideas of what it means.  The scriptures involved are Mat 22:23-30,\\nMark 12:18-25, and Luke 20:27-36.\\n\\nWhat happened was that the Sadducees, who did not believe in the\\nresurrection, thought they could trap Jesus.  They made reference to\\nthe \"Leverite\" marriage which required the brother of a man who died\\nwithout children to take the widow to wife and raise up children.  \\nThe children would be considered children of the deceased, just as\\nthough the woman\\'s first husband had fathered them.  It seems\\nobvious from this that the woman was still considered in a way to be\\nthe wife of her first husband.  However, the Sadducees concocted a\\nscene in which 6 brothers of the deceased each in his turn failed to\\nfather children by the widow.  They seem to imply that the Leverite\\nmarriage was equal to the first for they ask, \"Whose wife shall she\\nbe in the resurrection?\"  At this point it seems obvious that if she\\nis anybody\\'s wife, it is the first husband.  After all, had she\\nborne children they would have been credited to him regardless of\\nwhich brother was the biological father.  It is possible Jesus was\\nrefering to this when he says, \"Ye do err, not knowing the\\nscriptures or the power of God.\" (Mat 22:29, compare Mark 12:24,\\nphrase not in Luke\\'s account).\\n\\nAnyway, the Sadducees ask, \"Whose wife will she be in the\\nresurrection, seeing that all 7 had her?\"  Jesus answer is that,\\n\"In the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in\\nmarriage...\" (Mat 22:30) \"When they rise from the dead they neither\\nmarry...\" (Mark 12:25)  \"They which are accounted worthy to obtain\\nthat world neither marry...\" (Luke 20:35)  All 3 accounts go on to\\nsay, \"but are as the angels in heaven\" or the equivalent.

       " 'In the course of discussing the Sabbath with some folks, \\nI came across something that was completely new to me, \\nand I thought I\\'d offer it for comment.\\n\\nTo keep this as brief as possible, let me state my \\nobservation as a declarative statement, and then whoever \\nwants to can comment on it.  Basically, what I think \\nI\\'ve observed is that the phrase \"the Ten Commandments\", \\nas used by Moses, is not a reference to Ex. 20:1-17, but \\nrather a reference to ten distinct discourses from Ex. \\n20:1 through Ex. 31:18.  That is, the phrase \"the Ten \\nCommandments\" should more accurately be translated \"the \\nTen Discourses\", of which the passage we call the \"Ten \\nCommandments\" is really only the first.\\n\\nI\\'m not completely convinced that the above is true, but \\nfor purposes of discussion, let me argue it as though I \\nwas sure.\\n\\nArguments supporting the above idea:\\n\\n1)  There aren\\'t really ten commandments in Ex. 20:1-17.  \\nIn order to get 10 commandments, you have to get two of \\nthem out of verses 3-6, and the verses themselves do not \\nsupport such a division because they are all about not \\nworshipping other gods.  That is, verse 3 commands to \\nhave no other gods, and verse 5 commands to not worship \\nthe idols mentioned in verse 4.  You can\\'t violate \\nverses 5-6 without violating verse 3, indicating that \\nthe whole passage is one command, and leaving us with \\nonly Nine \"Commandments\".  I could go on at length about \\nthis, but for now I\\'ll just stop with this summary.\\n\\n2)  There ARE ten speeches between Ex 20:1 (the beginning\\nof the traditional \"Ten Commandments\") and Ex 31:18 \\n(where God actually gives Moses the two tablets with the \\nTen Commandments/Discourses written on them).  I break \\nthese ten down as follows: 20:1-17; 20:22-26; 21:1-23:33; \\n25:1-30:10; 30:11-16; 30:17-21; 30:22-33; 30:34-38; \\n31:1-11; and 31:12-18.  In most cases, each of these \\npassages begins with some variation of the phrase, \"And \\nthe LORD spoke to Moses, saying...\"  The exception is \\nEx. 21:1, which begins \"Now these are the ordinances \\nwhich you are to set before them...\"\\n\\n3)  The word translated \"commandments\" in the phrase \\n\"the Ten Commandments\" isn\\'t really the word for \\n\"commandment\", its the word for a speech, or an \\nutterance.  It\\'s a word often used for longer discourses \\nrather than individual statements; for instance, when \\ncombined with the word \\'yom\\' (day), this word is \\ntranslated \"Chronicles\" in such phrases as \"now the rest \\nof the acts of so-and-so, are they not written in the \\nChronicles of x?...\"  The word for \"commandment\" is \\nfreely used throughout the books of Moses, and perhaps \\nit is significant that when Moses spoke of the Ten X\\'s, \\nhe appears to have avoided the word for commandment and \\nchosen instead a word associated with discourses longer \\nthan just a single command.\\n\\n4)  God tells Moses that He is going to give him the \\nstone tablets \"with the law and the commandments\" (Ex \\n24:12), yet He does not give Moses the tablets until He \\nhas finished all ten discourses on Mount Sinai.  If the \\nTen Commandments were only Ex. 20:1-17, it is not \\nimmediately clear why God would wait several days and \\nnine more discourses before giving these tablets to \\nMoses.  On the other hand, if we have the Ten Discourses \\nwritten on the tablets, then it makes perfect sense that \\nGod would not give Moses the tablets until He had \\nfinished delivering all Ten Discourses.\\n\\n5)  When Moses did get the tablets, he found that both \\ntablets were written on both sides (Ex. 32:15).  If \\nthese Ten \"Commandments\" were only the first 17 verses \\nof Ex. 20, God would have had to have written in LARGE \\nletters!  Not that He couldn\\'t have, of course, but it \\ndoes seem more likely to me that this is a reference to \\ntwo tablets containing ten discourses written in normal-\\nsized letters.\\n\\n6)  In II Cor. 3, Paul seems to specifically single out \\nthe \"commandments written on stone\" as being the \\n\"ministry of death\", \"that which is fading away,\" and \\n\"the ministry of condemnation.\"  With the possible \\nexception of the commandment about the Sabbath, it is \\ndifficult to see why Paul would refer to the commands in \\nEx. 20:1-17 as being temporary, \"fading away\"-type \\ncommandments.  This is less of a problem if the stone \\ntablets should happen to have included all of the \\ncommandments from Ex 20 through Ex 31.\\n\\nArguments against this idea:\\n\\nThe main argument against this idea, aside from the fact \\nthat it contradicts a long-standing tradition, is that \\nin Dt 5:22, Moses says, after quoting the commands in \\nEx. 20:1-17, \"These words the LORD spoke...and He added \\nno more.  And He wrote them on two tablets of stone and \\ngave them to me.\"  This appears to identify the words \\njust quoted as being the only contents of the two stone \\ntablets.\\n\\nThat was my first impression, anyway.  However, after \\nsome thought, I noted that a great deal hinges on how \\nyou understand the phrase \"These words.\"  If Moses meant \\n\"These words *which I have just related to you* were \\nspoken by God\" etc., then that would mean that only the \\ntraditional \"Ten Commandments\" were on the stone \\ntablets.  If, however, Moses was making a parenthetical \\ncomment--\"These words *which I AM NOW telling you* were \\nspoken by God\" etc.--then that\\'s quite different.\\n\\nI did note that in the Dt 5 account, Moses tells of \\nbeing given the stone tablets BEFORE telling of the \\npeople asking Moses to represent them before God, \\nwhereas in the Exodus account, the people asked this of \\nMoses between the first and second discourses, several \\ndays BEFORE God gave Moses the stone tablets.  This \\nreinforces the idea that Moses\\' remarks in Dt 5:22ff \\nwere intended as a parenthetical remark, rather than a \\nstrictly chronological account of when God wrote what, \\nand at what point He stopped adding to what was on the \\ntablets.\\n\\nSummary:  all things considered, I find it somewhat more \\nlikely that the nine commands in Ex 20 are really only \\nthe first of what Moses regarded as the Ten Discourses \\nof God.  I don\\'t know if anybody has ever espoused this \\nidea before; it\\'s brand-new to me.  So, while I lean \\ntowards accepting it, I would be very interested in \\nhearing any comments and criticisms anyone may care to \\noffer.',\n",

One of \\nthe basic problems with something like \"clutch\" batting average - overall\\nbatting average is that the correlation from year to year is almost zero. \\nAdding to the sample size doesn\\'t seem to help much.  As a counterexample to \\nwhat you showed, consider the following two players from 1984-1987:\\n\\n               Non-Clutch                      Clutch\\n               AB      H       BA              AB      H       BA\\n \\nMaldonado      1060    260     .245            254     78      .307\\nLemon          1643    457     .278            256     57      .223\\n\\nIf you had had these two players in 1988, by your logic, in those \"clutch\"\\nsituations, you\\'d bat Maldonado for Lemon in a blink of an eye.  Well, in \\n1988, Maldonado hit .267 in \"non-clutch\" and .190 in \"clutch\", while Lemon\\nhit .254 in \"non-clutch\" and .313 in \"clutch\".  Before you accuse me of \\ncompletely cooking the data, there were 96 players who had 25+ \"clutch\"\\nat bats every year from 1984-1988 (according to Elias).  As a simple\\nmeasure of clutchness, let\\'s just look at clutch BA-non-clutch BA. If you use \\n\\'84-\\'87 to predict \\'88 for those 96 players, you\\'d find that 27 of the\\n96 were below league average in that measure both in \\'84-87 and in \\'88,\\n26 were above league average in both periods and the other 43 were \\nabove in one and below in the other.

If you decide in advance that your reason will act only on > the\\nevidence of the five physical senses, then you cut reason off from any >\\npossibility of reaching a conclusion outside the physical sphere (beyond the >\\nrather provocative, if inconclusive, conclusion that the physical sphere > is\\nnot self explanatory). \\n\\nSo your are saying to rely on our feelings and experiences (since\\nthis is the only other source of information left to us).\\nHow can you then convince somebody that your \"feelings and experiences\"\\nare the correct ones then if you can\\'t show somebody visible and\\nmeasurable effects?  If my experiences say that \"there exists no god\"\\nand yours says there does, where does that leave us?  Since we are only\\ngoing on experiences, then both of us are correct within our own personal\\nrealities.\\n\\nFurthermore, the trouble with \"feelings and experiences\" is that they\\ncan lead you astray, as the tragic outcome of Waco illustrates.  I\\nam sure that many of Koresh\\'s followers really believed in him but\\nI think that you and I will agree that they were being misled.\\n\\nFinally, how on earth do you come to the conclusion that the physical\\nsphere is not self-explanatory when you only rely on the five senses?\\n\\n\\nYou must be using a definition of \"evidence\" that I am not familiar with.\\nTo me, evidence is something you can show others -unambiguously- that\\nwhat you are saying is true.\\n\\nHowever, I agree with you that belief in a diety is a matter of faith.\\nIt is not something you can share around - others must experience it\\nindependantly.  Unfortunately, as I have explained above, this puts\\nbelief down to a matter of experience.  My impression is that Christians\\ndo not have the monopoly on reason, evidence and faith as far as any of\\nthese things can go.\\n\\n\\nAt the risk of repeating my argument : As I have explained previously, \\nthe trouble is that Moslems, Buddhists, Jews, etc will ALL say that THEY\\nclaim, with good reason, to be a valid system, possessed of the best\\nevidence, for explaining Gods revelations to man (for Buddhists it\\nshould read \"for explaining the non-existence of God\").  So not only\\nmust you \"prove\" your own case, you have to \"disprove\" theirs.\\n\\n(alt.messianic is a good place to see people strong in the belief\\nof their own faiths ... and with their own good reasons)\\n\\n\\nI know that ALL people can use reason ... I never claimed that they don\\'t.\\nI just wish to make sure that their arguments are well-founded.  It goes\\nwithout saying that if I make a blunder that I expect people to correct\\nme.  Once we have all gone through this process of removing the \\nnon-essential and contradictory bits, we should (hopefully) have made\\nsome progress towards the truth.\\n\\n',\n",

       " 'I am not sure if this is the proper group to post this to but here goes anyway.\\n\\n About five years ago my mother was diagnosed with having cancer in the lymph nodes\\n under one of her arms. After the doctors removed the cancerous area she had full movement\\n of her arm with only slight aching under her arm when she moved it. Over the course of\\n the next two years the aching got more severe and her complaining to the doctors produced\\n the explanation that it was scar tissue causing the pain. At this time her doctor \\n suggested that some physiotherapy should be employed to break up the scar tissue.\\n\\n While attending one of her therapy sessions, while her arm was being \\n manipulated, some damage occured (nerve?) which caused the level of pain to permanently\\n increase severly (controlled by Tylenol 3s) and some loss of use of the arm (\\n palsied wrist and almost no outward lateral movement). With great persistence on her part\\n the doctors looked further into the issue and discovered that not all of the cancer had\\n been removed and another tumor had grown under the arm. This was removed also but the\\n pain in the arm has not decreased. The doctors are not sure exactly why the pain is \\n persisting but feel some sort of nerve damage has occured and they have employed Tylenol 3\\n and soon Morphine to relieve the pain. She has tried acupuncture by this only provides\\n minor reductions in pain and is only short term.  \\n\\n My questions are: \\n\\n     Has anyone has heard of similar cases and what, if anything, was done to reduce the\\n     levels of pain?\\n\\n     Are their methods to block nerves so that the pain can be reduced?\\n\\n     Are their methods to restore nerves so that loss of arm function can be restored?\\n\\n\\n  Any general suggestions on pain reduction would be greatly appreciated.\\n  \\n  \\n  Please respond by email because I do not always get chance to read this group.\\n\\n  If anyone knows of some literature that may be useful to this case or another newsgroup\\n  that I should be posting this to it would also be appreciated.\\n   \\n     \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

       " '\\nOuch, this is a good question.

Quite likely, actually.\\n\\n                                                      [...I believe \"Jesus\\n   only\" originally was in the context of baptism.  These are folks who\\n   believe that baptism should be done with a formula mentioning only\\n   Jesus, rather than Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.  This may have\\n   doctrinal implications, but as far as I know it does not mean that\\n   these folks deny the existence or divinity of the Father.  I\\'m not the\\n   right one to describe this theology, and in fact I think there may be\\n   several, including what would classically be called monophysite or\\n   Arian (two rather different views), as well as some who have beliefs\\n   that are probably consistent with Trinitarian standards, but who won\\'t\\n   use Trinitarian language because they misunderstand it or simply\\n   because it is not Biblical.  --clh]\\n\\nNot Biblical?  What then can they make of the end of Matthew?\\n\\n(28:18)And Jesus came and said to them, \"All authority in heaven and on\\nearth has been given to me. (19)Go therefore and make disciples of all\\nnations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and\\nof the Holy Spirit, (20) and teaching them to obey everything that I\\nhave commanded to you.  And remember, I am with you always, to the end\\nof the age.\" {Other ancient authorities add *Amen*} [NRSV]\\n\\nThe notes give no sense that this is emended.  Do other texts\\ncontradict this regarding Baptism?  Or is a misunderstanding of the\\nTrinity the most likely explanation after all?\\n\\nBut maybe I simply misunderstand their views.  (Is anyone else out there\\nforced to read this group with both a good Bible and an unabridged\\ndictionary??  Christianity really is an education in itself.)\\n\\n--\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n[Arrgggghhhh.  When I talked about people who rejected Trinitarian\\nlanguage as unBiblical, I was speaking of Trinitarian theology, things\\nlike \"one essense and three persons\".  Obviously the three-fold\\nbaptismal formula is Biblical, as you point out.  (I normally use the\\nterm \"three-fold\" in referring to Mat.  While it is certainly\\nconsistent with belief in the Trinity, the Trinity is a doctrine whose\\nfull formulation occurred in the 4th and 5th Cent\\'s.  It\\'s unlikely\\nthat Mat. had in mind the fully-developed Trinitarian doctrine.\\nIndeed the three-fold baptismal formula is used by some groups that do\\nnot believe in the Trinity.)  The disagreement over baptismal formulae\\noccurs because of passages such as Acts 2:38, which command baptism in\\nthe name of Jesus.  (There are a couple of other passages in Acts as\\nwell.)  This leaves us with sort of a problem: we\\'re commanded in Mat.\\nto baptize in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit,\\nand in Acts to baptize in the name of Jesus.\\n\\n\"Jesus only\" groups baptize in the name of Jesus.  They consider this\\nconsistent with Mat 28:18, because they say that Jesus is the name of\\nthe Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.  I\\'m not the right one to\\nask to explain what this means.  I will simply say that it does not\\nappear to be normal Trinitarian theology.  (It is also an odd way of\\ndealing with the idiomatic phrase \"in the name of\".)\\n\\nThose who use the three-fold formula don\\'t seem to have a standard\\nanswer to the passages talking about baptizing in the name of Jesus.\\nI suspect that the most common explanation is to say that \"in the name\\nof\" need not be a verbal formula.  To say that you baptize in the name\\nof Jesus may simply mean that you are doing baptism under Jesus\\'\\nauthority.  In the 1st Cent. context, it contrasts Christian baptism\\nwith the baptism of John or other Jewish baptism.  Of course there\\'s a\\ncertain parallelism between these passages.  That suggests that we\\ncould just as well say that Mat 28:18 doesn\\'t require the specific\\nthree-fold formula to be used in baptism, but simply characterizes\\nbaptism done by those who follow the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.\\n\\nOne might well suspect that in the early church, more than one\\nbaptismal formula was used.  So long as we consider following Jesus to\\nbe the same as following the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, no great\\ndamage would be done by such a difference.  This does *not* mean that\\nI think we should go back to using both formulae.  Baptism is one of\\nthe few things that almost all Christian groups now recognize\\nmutually, so I do not think doing something to upset that would be in\\nthe interests of the Gospel.  This is reinforced by the fact that\\nthose groups that actually use \"in the name of Jesus\" now do seem to\\nhave in mind a difference in doctrine.  But as I\\'ve said before, I\\'m\\nnot the one to explain what their doctrine is.',\n",

Numerous articles in major newspapers \\n(London Times) and periodicals (Newsweek) during the war, had suggested \\nthe existence of a significant collaboration between Armenians and the \\nNazis. Arthur Derounian deserves credit for being the first person to \\ndeal with this issue extensively. Derounian\\'s motives were twofold: his \\ndeeply held democratic convictions gave him a sense of duty and he felt \\nobliged to shed light on this yet another dark chapter of Armenian history.\\nConcurrently, Derounian embarked on what one would call \\'crisis control\\' \\nor face-saving. In order to forestall any potential attacks on the larger \\nArmenian community in the United States, he marginalized collaboration \\nas deplorable but insignificant.[1]\\n\\n[1] John Roy Carlson (real name Arthur Derounian), \\'The Plotters,\\'\\n    E.

The \\n magazine was first published in Berlin in 1938 during Nazi rule of Germany\\n and continued publication until the end of 1944. Even the name of the\\n magazine, which implies a declaration of Armenian-Nazi cooperation,\\n is attention-getting.\\n\\n This magazine, every issue of which proves the collaboration, is historically\\n important as documentary evidence. It is a heap of writing that should be\\n an admonition to world opinion and to all mankind. \\n\\n In Nazi Germany, Armenians were considered to be an Aryan race and certain\\n political, economic, and social rights were thus granted to them. They \\n occupied positions in public service and were partners in Nazi practices.\\n The whole world of course knows what awaited those who were not considered \\n \"Aryan\" and what befell them.\\n\\nNow wait, there is more.\\n\\nSource: \"From Sardarapat to Sevres and Lausanne\" by Avetis Aharonian.

For\\n   Isaiah says, \\'Lord, who has believed our message?\\'  Consequently, faith\\n   comes from hearing the message, and the message is heard through the word\\n   of Christ.\"\\n\\n   So then we receive God\\'s gift of faith to us as we hear the message of the\\n   gospel.  Faith is a possible response to hearing God\\'s word preached.  Kids\\n   are not yet spiritually, intellectually, or emotionally mature enough to\\n   respond to God\\'s word.  Hence they cannot have faith and therefore cannot\\n   be raised in baptism to a new life.\\n\\nCatholics view the effects of Baptism slightly differently, and that\\'s\\none primary reason why they baptize babies.  They believe that Baptism\\nproduces a change in the soul of the baby, quite independently of any\\nvolitional act on the part of the baby.  This change in the baby\\'s\\nsoul gives the infant certain capabilities that he would not have\\nwithout Baptism.  Since the infant does not have the use of his\\nintellect and will yet, these new faculties are dormant.  But as the\\nchild gets older, the gifts of Baptism come more and more into play.\\n\\n   Ezekiel 18:20 \"The soul who sins will die.  The son will not share the\\n   guilt of the father, nor will the father share the guilt of the son.

So we can have no original guilt from Adam.\\n\\nAdam was given a number of gifts by God.  The chief among them was\\nwhat Catholics call \"sanctifying grace\".  (In the New Testament, the\\nword used for this is \"charity\".)  By his sin, Adam lost this grace.\\nHe didn\\'t lose it just for himself, however, he lost it for the whole\\nhuman race.  Because once he lost it, he couldn\\'t pass it on to his\\ndescendents.\\n\\nThat\\'s why Catholics baptize babies.  Through his Original Sin, Adam\\nlost sanctifying grace for all his descendents.

       " 'Disclaimer -- This is for fun.\\n\\nIn my computerized baseball game, I keep track of a category called\\n\"stolen hits\", defined as a play made that \"an average fielder would not\\nmake with average effort.\"  Using the 1992 Defensive Averages posted\\nby Sherri Nichols (Thanks Sherri!), I\\'ve figured out some defensive stats\\nfor the leftfielders. Hits Stolen have been redefined as \"Plays Kevin\\nBass would not have made.\"\\n\\nOK, I realize that\\'s unfair.  Kevin\\'s probably the victim of pitching staff,\\nfluke shots, and a monster park factor.  But let\\'s put it this way:  If we\\nreplaced every leftfielder in the league with someone with Kevin\\'s 49.4% out\\nmaking ability, how many extra hits would go by?\\n\\nTo try and correlate it to reality a little more, I\\'ve calculated Net\\nHits Stolen, based on the number of outs made compared to what a league\\naverage fielder would make.  By the same method I\\'ve calculated Net Extra \\nBases (doubles and triples let by).\\n\\nFinally, I throw all this into a a formula I call Defensive Contribution, or\\nDCON :->.  Basically, it represents the defensive contribution of a player.\\nI add this number to OPS to get DOPS (Defense + Onbase Plus Slug), which\\nshould represent the player\\'s total contribution to the team.  So don\\'t\\ntake it too seriously.  The formula for DCON appears at the end of this\\narticle.\\n\\nThe short version -- definition of terms\\nHS -- Hits Stolen -- Extra outs compared to Kurt Stillwell\\nNHS -- Net Hits Stolen -- Extra outs compared to average fielder\\nNDP -- Net Double Plays -- Extra double plays turned compared to avg fielder\\nNEB -- Net Extra Bases --  Extra bases prevented compared to avg. fielder\\nDCON -- Defensive Contribution -- bases and hits prevented, as a rate.\\nDOPS -- DCON + OPS -- quick & dirty measure of player\\'s total contribution.\\n\\nNational League\\n\\nName            HS   NHS   NEB   DCON    DOPS\\nGonzalez, L.    63    28    20   .192    .866\\nGilkey, B.      52    23    14   .150    .941\\nClark, G.       46    11    11   .065    .726\\nAlou, M.        20     3    12   .052    .835\\nBonds, B.       54     9    -7   .019   1.099\\nMay, D.         21     0    -7  -.020    .659\\nGant, R.        31    -5    -2  -.021    .715\\nBass, K.         0   -24    -4  -.126    .600\\n\\nOrdered by DOPS\\n\\n1.099 Bonds\\n .941 Gilkey\\n .866 Gonzalez\\n .835 Alou\\n .726 Clark\\n .718 *NL Average*\\n .715 Gant\\n .659 May\\n .600 Bass\\n\\n\\nAmerican League\\n---------------\\n\\nName            HS   NHS   NEB   DCON    DOPS\\nRaines, T.      53    22    20   .111    .896\\nAnderson, B.    65    30     8   .102    .924\\nHenderson, R.   43    20     4   .101    .984\\nVaughn, G.      55    27    -3   .095    .817\\nGladden, D.     25     4     8   .038    .699\\nHall, M.        29     6    -2   .017    .756\\nMack, S.        38     6    -8   .005    .866\\nPolonia, L.     10   -11    10  -.019    .647\\nMcReynolds, K.  13    -8    -9  -.064    .711\\nMaldanado, C.    9   -21   -12  -.105    .714\\nReimer, K.       5   -18   -16  -.102    .671\\n\\n\\nOrder by DOPS\\n\\n.984 Henderson\\n.924 Anderson\\n.896 Raines\\n.866 Mack\\n.817 Vaughn\\n.756 Hall\\n.733 *AL Average*\\n.714 Maldanado\\n.711 McReynolds\\n.699 Gladden\\n.671 Reimer\\n.647 Polonia\\n\\nMore discussion --\\n\\nDCON formula:  ((NHS + NDP)/PA) + ((NHS + NDP + NEB)/AB)\\nWhy such a bizzare formula?

       " '\\n\\nThere was an article in USA today a few months ago showing the results\\nof a study that actually only about 1% were homosexual.  I saw another\\nfigure that listed 2% as the figure.  Of course, even if it were 99%\\nthat would have little bearing on whether or not it is a sinful behavior.\\nHow many people have commited other acts of fornication?  How many\\npeople have lied or sinned in other ways?\\n\\n\\nWhy isn\\'t it a specific feature of homosexuality?  Paul describes\\n\"men with men working that which is unseemly\" to describe the acts.  \\nSure, there spirtual nature was depraved also, and like the other\\nsins, the idolatry, the other sexual immoraity, and the other sins\\nsprang from their depraved spiritual state which was a result of \\nman\\'s not glorifying God as God and being thankful.  Still, their\\nacts were shameless.\\n\\n\\nIs everything sinful specifically elaborated on in the New Testament?\\nScripture does not condemn being a drug dealer.  Being ruled by the\\nSpirit rather than the letter not only frees from legalism, it also\\nprotects us from sins that are against the Spirit.  The word is a\\ntwo edged sword that cuts both ways.  \\n\\nI think we must be careful before we totally throw out Leviticus.  \\nIf the Law is reflection of God\\'s character and true holy nature, then\\nthose who say that God endorses homosexuality run into a problem.  \\nIf homosexuality were \"natural\" (whatever that means) wholesome, \\nendorsed by God, and those who oppose sexual behavior are narrow-minded\\nbiggots, as some would have us believe, why is there a condemnation of\\nit in Leviticus.  This condemnation is in the midst of all the other\\nsex sin condemnations, and there is nothing in the text to say that this\\nlaw was limited to temple prostitution, and no good reason to believe that\\nthis was the case.  Furthermore, male homosexual sex was a death-penalty\\ncrime!  \\n\\nIs every sin elaborated on in the New Testament?  Take a look at\\nI Corinthians 5.  Paul said that one of the Corinthians had broken a\\nlaw not even heard of among the Gentiles, that one should have his father\\'s\\nwife.  There is a prohibition against having your father\\'s wife in \\nLeviticus.  No other new Testament verse clearly condemns it (besides\\nthis one.)  Notice that Paul did not say that the sin was in commiting\\nadultery, etc.- he spoke against having one\\'s father\\'s wife.  \\n\\nNotice also that this sexual condemnation in Leviticus is not mentioned\\nin the specific context of paganism either.  And there was no pagan \\ncoustom mentioned in I corinthians either.  As a matter of fact\\ntaking one\\'s father\\'s wife wasn\\'t even done among the Gentiles.  It was\\njust a plain blantant sin, whether worshipping idols was involved or\\nnot.\\n\\n\\nOne of the reasons that some of us do not accept that common argument\\nis because Paul probably did face this and other problems.  Sin can\\nbe tough to over come, especially without supernatural power.  Is\\nhomosexual sin any more difficult to overcome that heterosexual sin,\\nlike lusting after a married woman, or sleeping around with people of\\nthe opposite sex?  I doubt it, and even if it is, that is no excuse.\\nGod is greater than all of it. \\n\\nAnother reason we reject it is because it ignores the supernatural\\npower of God to intervene in this kind of situation.  How many \\npeople have been set free from sin by the power of God?  Sure there\\nmay be any groups that have tried to change homosexuals and failed.\\nThat is a reflection on the people involved in the program, and not\\nGod\\'s willingness and ability to change a sinner.  Any program that\\nuses formulas may fail.  What people need is the power of God to\\nchange them, whether they are involved in homosexual sin, or any other\\nsin.\\n\\n\\nI don\\'t see how you come to that conclusion.  Paul\\'s dealings with\\npastorial issues encouraged people to give up their liberties in order\\nto spare others- not to allow people to continue in sin because it\\nwas just too difficult.  Take the example of eating meat offered to idols.\\nPaul felt that there was nothing wrong, in an abstract sense, with\\neating the meat.  Yet he advised believers to sacrifice their liberty\\nto eat meat in order to spare others.  \\n\\nBut Paul never allowed people to sin because living holy was just to\\ntough.  Paul wrote to \"make no provision for the flesh to fulfill the lusts\\nthereof.\"  (Romans 13:14)  Then he goes in to a discourse on how we\\nshould sacrifice our own liberty in order to spare the consciences of others.\\n\\nSuppose it were not a sin for people to practice homosexual acts.  \\nSince others consider it to be a sin, then using Paul\\'s approach\\non pastorial issues, those who would otherwise be homosexuals should \\nsacrifice their liberty and be celbate or monogamously married to a\\nmember of the opposite sex.  Paul never offers a lesser sin (homosexual\\n\"marriage\") to prevent people from engaging in what may be considered \\na more damaging sin.\\n\\n\\nYet marriage itself is not a sin.  marriage is holy in all- and something\\nthat God ordains, and Paul recognizes this.\\n\\n\\nActually, Adam was put in the garden to tend to it before he fell.\\nAfter he fell he would have to toil over the ground.\\n\\n\\nThat is why we are dependent totally on God- what a vunerable and glorious\\nposition to be it.  We all must be transformed by the renewing of our\\nminds- and that is the only way homosexuals can walk in freedom, just\\nlike anyone else.\\n\\n\\nI\\'m sure you can see how people with the opposing view see this \\nconclusion.  It\\'s like saying, \"How should I kill myself, with gun or\\naresenic?  What about the person who just is overcome with a desire to\\nsleep with goats?  Would it be better for him to sleep with one goat,\\nor all of them?  What about the person who wants to sleep with his aunts?\\nWould it be better for him to sleep with one aunt or all of them?  \\n\\nIn all these cases, the more people or animals one sleeps with, the higher\\nthe chance that they will get a disease.  But this only deals with \\nphysical aspects of the question.  Whichever sin is commited, it all \\nleads to spiritual death.\\n\\n\\nThe issue that is most often addressed in Scripture seems to be the\\nactual act.  Second, isn\\'t it historical snobbery to say that\\nonly homosexuals of this century are capable of having \"loving\\nrelationships?\"  There are ancient writings glorifying homosexual \"love.\"\\n(btw, I am one who believes in refraining from making oathes.

       " '\\nI agree and disagree.  John is saying that the batters efforts will result\\nin 4 more wins then losses.  While you are probably correct that 400%\\ndoes not mean 4 more wins then losses, it means something.  I would\\nrather have a player who increased my teams chances of winning by 1% in\\neach of 400 PAs then I would a player who increased my chances of winning\\nby .5% in each of 400 PAs.  Thus, there appears to me to be an obvious\\npositive association between John\\'s statistic and winning games.  Thus,\\nbefore you disregard this stat, it appears to me that further study must\\ngo into what sort of relationship there is.\\n\\n\\nThe only problem here is an insistance that these number mean exactly\\nhow many wins the team has.  First, we are using averages over many\\nseasons and applying them to one game.  Second, remember some players\\nperformance take away from the chance of you winning.  That is a\\nplayer who gets an out gets a \"negative probability\" in most cases.\\nThus, I\\'m not sure in any given game when you add up all the numbers\\nfor a team who won that they will add up to 1 in that game.  Sometimes,\\nthey will add up to more then one sometime, less than one.  Also,\\nthe pitchers\\' bad performances (giving up 6 runs) may have given\\nthem a large negative percentage for that game.  Also, any batter that\\npulled an 0-4 night would give large negatives.  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNo, but really only because you have a smaller sample size.  I would\\nthink however, that the number of runs you score in the first inning\\nwould be just as good as a prediction as how many runs you score \\nin the last inning.  And, realize something else a closer usually\\ncomes in in a close situation, not a blow out.  It is hard to argue\\nthat any runs that a closer gives up in a game have equal importance\\nto those given up in the first inning.  Look, a closer giving up runs\\noften means a team will lose many games.  On, the other hand a starter\\nwho gives up runs often still leaves his team a chance to win.  The\\noffence has many more outs to do something about.  But, I am not\\nsaying all late inning situations are equally important either.  If\\nI am down 8 runs in the ninth, it really does not matter how many\\nruns my pitcher gives up in the ninth.       \\n\\n\\n\\nNo, but why would you assume that the teams probability of winning would\\nbe 0 before the possesion in which the free throws were made.  Look,\\nif you are down 1 point with 5 seconds left, there is a fairly high\\nprobability that you will win the game if you are in possesion of the\\nball.  And, do not forget that somebody elses missed shots, turnovers,\\nfouls, bad defense, etc. caused a \"negative chance\" that the team\\nwould win.\\n \\nFrom reading all of the discussion on this statistic, I feel that those\\nwho critisize it to a certain extent are doing so out of an agenda.\\nAt first look this statistic valadates clutchness.  But, it really\\ndoes not.  Cluthness revolves around the idea that certain players\\nin crucial situation elevate their performance and others performance\\ngoes down.  I\\'ve never seen convincing proof that this really happens.\\nSo, if you assume there is no clutchness, then that means that except\\nfor a lot of noice, this statistic has a positive association to\\nplayer performance.  There is a way to get rid of the noice if you\\ndo not believe in clutchness.  Certainly, we could find out what\\nthe average value of a home run is for example.  We may find for\\ninstance, that a home run increases your chance of winning by 15%\\non average while a strikeout decreases your chance of winning by 5%.\\nI bet if this were done we would find that this statistic was just\\nas good as other statistics we have for predicting wins and losses.\\n\\nHow do we evaluate relief pitchers?  Say John and Sam have the\\nexact same pitching statistics (runs, earned runs, K\\'s, BB\\'s,\\netc.)  Both had exceptional numbers.  John, however only pitched\\nin closer situations, while Sam was a Mop up man.  Who was more\\nvaluble to their team?  Probably John.  Who was the better \\npitcher?  They were probably about the same.',\n",

As soon as you possibly can.  The\\ndifference of a day or two can mean the difference between a short recovery\\nand a long, drawn-out ordeal.  GO SEE A DOCTOR.  Now, your garden-variety\\ndoctor may not necessarily be familiar with this sort of injury.  Generally,\\nany hospital with an occupational therapy clinic will offer specialists in\\nthese kinds of problems.  DON\\'T WAIT, THOUGH.  GO SEE A DOCTOR.\\n\\nThe remainder of this information is paraphrased, without permission, from\\na wonderful report by New Zealand\\'s Department of Labour (Occupational\\nSafety and Health Service): \"Occupational Overuse Syndrome. Treatment and\\nRehabilitation: A Practitioner\\'s Guide\".\\n\\nFirst, a glossary (or, fancy names for how you shouldn\\'t have your hands):\\n(note: you\\'re likely to hear these terms from doctors and keyboard vendors :)\\n\\n  RSI: Repetitive Strain Injury - a general term for many kinds of injuries\\n  OOS: Occupational Overuse Syndrome -- synonym for RSI\\n  CTD: Cumulative Trauma Disorder -- another synonym for RSI\\n  WRULD: Work-Related Upper Limb Disorders -- yet another synonym for RSI\\n  CTS: Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (see below)\\n  Hyperextension:  Marked bending at a joint.\\n  Pronation: Turning the palm down.\\n  Wrist extension: Bending the wrist up.\\n  Supination: Turning the palm up.\\n  Wrist flexion: Bending the wrist down.\\n  Pinch grip: The grip used for a pencil.\\n  Ulnar deviation: Bending the wrist towards the little finger.\\n  Power grip: The grip used for a hammer.\\n  Radial Deviation: Bending the wrist toward the thumb.\\n  Abduction: Moving away from the body.\\n  Overspanning: Opening the fingers out wide.\\n\\nNow then, problems come in two main types: Local conditions and diffuse\\nconditions.  Local problems are what you\\'d expect: specific muscles,\\ntendons, tendon sheaths, nerves, etc. being inflamed or otherwise hurt.\\nDiffuse conditions, often mistaken for local problems, can involve muscle\\ndiscomfort, pain, burning and/or tingling; with identifiable areas of\\ntenderness in muscles, although they\\'re not necessarily \"the problem.\"\\n\\n--- Why does Occupational Overuse Syndrome occur?  Here\\'s the theory.\\n\\nNormally, your muscles and tendons get blood through capillaries which\\npass among the muscle fibers.  When you tense a muscle, you restrict\\nthe blood flow.  By the time you\\'re exerting 50% of your full power,\\nyou\\'re completely restricting your blood flow.\\n\\nWithout fresh blood, your muscles use stored energy until they run out,\\nthen they switch to anaerobic (without oxygen) metabolism, which generates\\nnasty by-products like lactic acid, which cause pain.\\n\\nOnce one muscle hurts, all its neighbors tense up, perhaps to relieve the\\nload.  This makes sense for your normal sort of injury, but it only makes\\nthings worse with repetitive motion.  More tension means less blood flow,\\nand the cycle continues.\\n\\nAnother by-product of the lack of blood flow is tingling and numbness from\\nyour nerves.  They need blood too.\\n\\nAnyway, when you\\'re typing too much, you\\'re never really giving a change\\nfor the blood to get back where it belongs, because your muscles never\\nrelax enough to let the blood through.  Stress, poor posture, and poor\\nergonomics, only make things worse.\\n\\n--- Specific injuries you may have heard of:\\n\\n(note: most injuries come in two flavors: acute and chronic.  Acute\\ninjuries are severely painful and noticable.  Chronic conditions have\\nless pronounced symptoms but are every bit as real.)\\n\\nTenosynovitis -- an inflamation of the tendon sheath.  Chronic tenosynovitis\\noccurs when the repetitive activity is mild or intermittent: not enough to\\ncause acute inflamation, but enough to exceed the tendon sheath\\'s ability\\nto lubricate the tendon.  As a result, the tendon sheath thickens, gets\\ninflamed, and you\\'ve got your problem.\\n\\nTendonitis -- an inflammation of a tendon.  Repeated tensing of a tendon\\ncan cause inflamation.  Eventually, the fibers of the tendon start separating,\\nand can even break, leaving behind debris which induces more friction, more\\nswelling, and more pain.  \"Sub-acute\" tendonitis is more common, which entails\\na dull ache over the wrist and forearm, some tenderness, and it gets worse\\nwith repetitive activity.\\n\\nCarpal Tunnel Syndrome -- the nerves that run through your wrist into your\\nfingers get trapped by the inflamed muscles around them.  Symptoms include\\nfeeling \"pins and needles\", tingling, numbness, and even loss of sensation.\\nCTS is often confused for a diffuse condition.\\n\\nAdverse Mechanical Tension -- also known as \\'neural tension\\', this is where\\nthe nerves running down to your arm have become contracted and possibly\\ncompressed as a result of muscle spasms in the shoulders and elsewhere.\\nAMT can often misdiagnosed as or associated with one of the other OOS \\ndisorders.  It is largely reversible and can be treated with physiotherapy \\n(brachial plexus stretches and trigger point therapy).\\n\\nOthers: for just about every part of your body, there\\'s a fancy name for\\na way to injure it.  By now, you should be getting an idea of how OOS\\nconditions occur and why.  Just be careful: many inexperienced doctors\\nmisdiagnose problems as Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, when in reality, you\\nmay have a completely different problem.  Always get a second opinion\\nbefore somebody does something drastic to you (like surgery).\\n\\n==4== Typing posture, ergonomics, prevention, treatment\\n\\nThe most important element of both prevention and recovery is to reduce\\ntension in the muscles and tendons.  This requires learning how to relax.\\nIf you\\'re under a load of stress, this is doubly important.  Tune out\\nthe world and breath deep and regular.  Relaxing should become a guiding\\nprinciple in your work: every three minutes take a three second break.\\nEVERY THREE MINUTES, TAKE A THREE SECOND BREAK.  Really, do it every\\nthree minutes.  It\\'s also helpful to work in comfortable surroundings,\\ncalm down, and relax.\\n\\nIf you can\\'t sleep, you really need to focus on this.  Rest, sleep, and\\nrelaxation are really a big deal.\\n\\nThere are all kinds of other treatments, of course.  Drugs can reduce\\ninflamation and pain.  Custom-molded splints can forcefully prevent bad\\nposture.  Surgery can fix some problems.  Exercise can help strengthen\\nyour muscles.  Regular stretching can help prevent injury.  Good posture\\nand a good ergonomic workspace promote reduced tension.  Ice or hot-cold\\ncontrast baths also reduce swelling.  Only your doctor can say what\\'s best\\nfor you.\\n\\n--- Posture -- here are some basic guidelines.  [I so liked the way this was\\nwritten in the New Zealand book that I\\'m lifting it almost verbatim from\\nAppendix 10. -- dwallach]\\n\\n. Let your shoulders relax.\\n. Let your elbows swing free.\\n. Keep your wrists straight.\\n. Pull your chin in to look down - don\\'t flop your head forward.\\n. Keep the hollow in the base of your spine.\\n. Try leaning back in the chair.\\n. Don\\'t slouch or slump forward.\\n. Alter your posture from time to time.\\n. Every 20 minutes, get up and bend your spine backward.\\n\\nSet the seat height, first.  Your feet should be flat on the floor.  There \\nshould be no undue pressure on the underside of your thighs near the knees,\\nand your thighs should not slope too much.\\n\\nNow, draw yourself up to your desk and see that its height is comfortable\\nto work at.  If you are short, this may be impossible.  The beest remedy\\nis to raise the seat height and prevent your legs from dangling by using a\\nfootrest.\\n\\nNow, adjust the backrest height so that your buttocks fit into the space\\nbetween the backrest and the seat pan.  The backrest should support you in\\nthe hollow of your back, so adjust its tilt to give firm support in this\\narea.\\n\\nIf you operate a keyboard, you will be able to spend more time leaning\\nback, so experiment with a chair with a taller backrest, if available.\\n\\n[Now, I diverge a little from the text]\\n\\nA good chair makes a big difference.  If you don\\'t like your chair, go\\nfind a better one.  You really want adjustments for height, back angle,\\nback height, and maybe even seat tilt.  Most arm rests seem to get in\\nthe way, although some more expensive chairs have height adjustable arm\\nrests which you can also rotate out of the way.  You should find a good\\nstore and play with all these chairs -- pick one that\\'s right for you.\\nIn the San Francisco Bay Area, I highly recommend \"Just Chairs.\"  The\\nname says it all.\\n\\n--- Keyboard drawers, wrist pads, and keyboard replacements:\\n\\nThere is a fair amount of controvery on how to get this right.  For some\\npeople, wrist pads seem to work wonders.  However, with good posture, you\\nshouldn\\'t be resting your wrists on anything -- you would prefer your\\nkeyboard to be \"right there\".  If you drop your arms at your side and then\\nlift your hands up at the elbow, you want your keyboard under your hands\\nwhen your elbows are at about 90 degrees.  Of course, you want to avoid\\npronation, wrist extension, and ulnar deviation at all costs.  Wrist pads\\nmay or may not help at this.  You should get somebody else to come and\\nlook at how you work: how you sit, how you type, and how you relax.  It\\'s\\noften easier for somebody else to notice your hunched shoulders or\\ndeviated hands.\\n\\nSome argue that the normal, flat keyboard is antiquated and poorly\\ndesigned.  A number of replacements are available, on the market, today.\\nCheck out the accompanying typing-injury-faq/keyboards for much detail.\\n\\n==5== Requests for more info\\n\\nClearly, the above information is incomplete.  The typing-injury archive\\nis incomplete.  There\\'s always more information out there.  If you\\'d like\\nto submit something, please send me mail, and I\\'ll gladly throw it in.\\n\\nIf you\\'d like to maintain a list of products or vendors, that would be\\nwonderful!  I\\'d love somebody to make a list of chair/desk vendors.  I\\'d\\nlove somebody to make a list of doctors.  I\\'d love somebody to edit the\\nabove sections, looking for places where I\\'ve obviously goofed.\\n\\n==6== References\\n\\nI completely rewrote the information section here, using a wonderful\\nguide produced in New Zealand by their Occupational Safety & Health\\nService, a service of their Department of Labour.

He gave references to all his\\nconclusions and as I have stated, for the last 25 years I have used his\\nconclusions in debates at RC seminaries and brotherhoods, not to mention the\\nindividual priests and bishops that I have talked to one on one.  No counter to\\nHislops scholarship was made.  The only rebuttals were against his conclusions\\nbecause they do totally undermined the claims of the RCC.

The dear old aunt (now \\ndeceased) was very proud of her Jewish heritage, although not especially\\ndevout.

Now, this\\nis not what I had to come to talk about.  But every time I tried to \\nbring up the subject of Judaism, they would condemn Jews for Jesus\\nand admonish me against converting to Judaism, \"because it involves\\ntoo much study and effort.\"  And I did not even raise the prospect, nor\\ntry to convert them to the truth of Christ!

The typical\\nX    start date for contests is in early March.  Contest rules are normally not\\nX    finalized and posted until the beginning of the contest.  The typical\\nX    closing date for contests are in early May.\\nX\\nX    The rules and the guidelines may (and often do) change from year to\\nX    year.

       " 'There has been quite a bit of discussion about house wiring and grounding\\npractices here.  A few points need to be clarified:\\n\\nThe Equipment GROUNDING conductor, Green, green with a yellow stripe, bare, or\\nthe metal sheath or pipe of SOME wiring methods, is used as a safety ground, to\\ncarry fault currents back to the circuit breaker panel, and to limit the\\nvoltage on the metal case of utilization equipment or other metal objects.  It\\nshould never (except for a few exceptions to be discussed later) carry the\\nnormal operating current of a connected load.  Some equipment has filters in\\nthe power supply which may cause some slight current flow through the grounding\\nconductor.  \\n\\nMuch communications or audio equipment is sensitive to noise or slight voltages\\non the grounding conductor, and may require special wiring of the grounding\\nconductors to provide reliable operation  (\"orange\" outlets are often used for\\nthis, with insulated grounding conductors wired back to the panel box, and in\\nmany cases back to the service.  Anyone installing such a system should read\\nboth the section on grounding in the National Electric Code and publications on\\ninstalling quiet isolated ground systems.  The code requires the insulated\\ngrounding conductors (green wires) to run with the current carrying conductors\\nback to the panel box, and, if required, back all the way to the service\\nentrance , where it is bonded to the service ground (water pipe or rod)  Many\\nof these systems are installed illegally or unsafely, where they do not provide\\na safe ground or a quiet ground or either. \\n\\nThe GROUNDED conductor of a circuit, often called the NEUTRAL, which is\\nreferred to in the code as the \"identified\" conductor and is supposed to be\\nwhite or natural grey.  This conductor is supposed to be connected to ground in\\nmost electrical systems at a single point, generally at the service entrance\\npanel.  This connection is through the Main Bonding Jumper.  (In many household\\nservice panels, the main bonding jumper is actually a bonding screw which\\nattaches the neutral busbar to the case of the panel)  \\n\\nThe Grounded conductor (neutral) is generally a current carrying conductor.  In\\nthe case of a 120 volt circuit it is one of the two conductors completing the\\ncircuit from the panel to the load device.  \\n\\nSince the grounded conductor (neutral) is only connected to the grounding\\nconductor (bare or green) at the service entrance, if the load is any distance\\nfrom the service and draws any significant current, there will be a small but\\nmeasurable voltage between the grounded and grounding conductors at the load,\\nunder normal operating conditions.  If you should (incorrectly) connect the\\ngrounded (neutral) conductor to the grounding conductor at the load, some of\\nthe neutral current will flow instead through the grounding conductor.  Since\\nthere will now be current flowing through the grounding conductor, it will also\\nno longer be quite at ground potential at the load end.  If the load equipment\\nhas a metal case, which is connected to the grounding conductor through the \"U\"\\nground plug, the metal case is now also no longer quite at ground potential. \\nThe difference (under normal, non short-circuit conditions) may be only a few\\ntenths of a volt, but it could also be a volt or two.  This normally does not\\npresent a shock hazard.  \\n\\nHOWEVER, if you let the metal case of the grounded equipment come into contact\\nwith an independently grounded object such as a water or gas pipe, a radiator,\\na metal air conditioning duct or such, part of the neutral current will try to\\nflow through this aalternate ground path.  If the contact is not solid, you\\nwill get a significant arc (a low voltage, but possibly moderate current arc)\\nUnder the wrong conditions, this arcing could start a fire.  It is possible in\\nsome cases that the sneak ground current   could also flow through a wire of\\ninadequate size, causing it to overheat.\\n\\nWith the incorrect non single-point grounding of the neutral, if there is a\\nshort circuit from hot to neutral, the high short circuit current which may\\nflow will cause a much higher voltage on the grounding conductor, which\\nincreases the possibility for shock or fire.  \\n\\nAlso if you incorrectly multiply connect the neutral and ground, the voltage on\\nthe ground system is seen as noise bu computer or audio equipment, often\\ncausing malfunction.  I have spent some hours tracking down such shorts in\\ntechnical facilities where they were inducing severe hum into equipment.\\n\\nThe Neutral is usually bonded to the ground at the distribution transformer as\\nwell as at the service entrance of each dwelling.  This is done primarily for\\nlightning protection, so that induced lightning currents have a short path back\\nto ground, and also to assure that the currents drawn by shorts to grounded\\nobjects like pipes draw enough current to trip circuit breakers or blow fuses\\nquickly.  The bad side of this is that not all the neutral current from the\\ndwelling goes through the neutral wire back to the transformer.  Some of it\\nflows through the grounding electrode (water pipe, etc.) this may cause\\ncorrosion in the pipes and possibly in things like underground fuel oil tanks,\\nand it may also cause measurable AC magnetic fields due to the large loop\\nbetween the \"hot\" conductors in the service and the neutral current in the\\nwater pipe and ground.  There are those who feel these fields may be unhealthy. \\n(don\\'t flame ME on this, I\\'m just telling you where the field comes from, not\\nit\\'s health effect, as far as I\\'m concerned, the jury is still out on this.)\\n\\nNote that the bonding jumper is only installed at the main panel, NOT at any\\nsub distribution panels.  This is one reason why it is illegal to run service\\nentrance cable with the sheath used as a neutral to a sub panel, you must have\\na seperate insulated conductor for the neutral.  The sheath can be used in this\\napplication only as the groundING conductor.  If the neutral is bonded to the\\ngrounding conductor in the sub panel, say by forgetting to remove the bonding\\nscrew, all the grounding conductors of the loads on that panel will be above\\nground, with the possible problems listed above.\\n\\nThe code makes exceptions for ranges and dryers, as well as feeds from one\\nbuilding to another.  In the cases of the range and dryer, the neutral may be\\nused as the equipment ground under certain conditions, instead of a seperate\\nwire.  Every time the code is revised, these exceptions come up for review. \\nThese exceptions were, in fact the first required safety grounds, in the days\\nbefore U ground outlets and such.  The appliance manufacturers don\\'t want to\\nhave to redesign their ranges and driers, and the contractors don\\'t want to\\nhave to run four wire cable (with four fairly heavy, expensive wires) in place\\nof three wire to the appliances.  No question it would be safer with seperate\\nneutrals to the stove, but the neutral current is low for most burner settings\\n(since most current is in the 220 volt \"hots\" except at some low settings, the\\nwires are large gauge, and there are few reported cases of injury or damage. \\nSo far, the exceptions have survived. In the case of feeds between buildings,\\nit\\'s primarily for lightning protection.\\n\\nPeople doing wiring should be aware what is and what isn\\'t a legal grounding\\nconductor.  Obviously, the bare wire in \"romex\" \\'with ground\\' is.  Anywhere\\nthere is a green wire installed, such as in a portable cord, that is a good\\ngrounding conductor.  The sheath of BX clamped in BX connectors in metal boxes\\nis a legal grounding conductor (in the US). (BX has an aluminum band run under\\nthe steel sheath to lower the resistance of the sheath.  You can just cut this\\naluminum band off at the ends, you don\\'t have to bond it to anything, it does\\nits job by touching every turn of the BX sheath.) Conduit or EMT (thinwall\\ntubing) is generally a legal grounding conductor, but may require a bonding\\nlocknut where it enters a box or panel, particularly for larger pipes.  \\n\\n\"Greenfield\" (looks like big BX, but you pull your own wires in the empty\\nsheath after you run it) is NOT a legal grounding conductor, as it doesn\\'t have\\nthe aluminum band to bond it, and the spiral steel has too much resistance and\\ninductance.  You have to run a seperate green grounding conductor inside the\\ngreenfield.\\n\\n\"Wiremold\" is also not a legal grounding conductor, as the paint on the boxes\\noften prevents good contact, and the \"feed\" to the wiremold extension is often\\nfrom a box in the wall that may not be well connected to the first wiremold\\nbox.  I have personally discovered cases where the entire run of wiremold and\\nthe cases of everything plugged into all the outlets on the run were \"hot\" with\\n120 volts (Why do I get a shock every time I touch my computer and the radiator\\nhere in the office?) because there was no ground wire in the wiremold and one\\nof the outlets had shorted to the edge of the wiremold box.  You must run a\\nground wire back in the wiremold from the outlets at least to the first box in\\nthe original wiring (conduit, BX, etc.) where you can \"bond\" the wire to the\\nbox with a screw, bnding clip, or whatever.\\n\\nOn another issue, while you should ground the green wire/lug on GCFI outlets\\nwhen ever there is a place to ground them, it is legal in the NEC to use them\\nwithout a ground if no ground is available.  It is better to have the\\nprotection of the Ground fault interrupter than no protection if you don\\'t\\ninstall it.  The interrupter doesn\\'t depend on the ground to trip.  It is\\ndesirable to connect the ground if available, because if the ground is\\nconnected, the interrupter will trip as soon as a faulty device is plugged in,\\nwhereas without the ground, it will not trip until someone or something\\nprovides a ground path.  For those questioning the legal use of ungrounded\\nGCFI\\'s, read in the NEC, 210-7 (d) exception. (This is the 1990 code, my \\'93\\ncode is in the city, but I know the rule hasn\\'t changed.  It might be\\nrenumbered though.) \\n\\nWe have only touched the surface concerning grounding ;-} , there is much more\\nto this subject, but most of you have fallen asleep by now.  \\n\\nJohn',\n",

In comparison, in \\nthe United States, reported cases of gonorrhea in 1992 continued an overall \\ndecreasing trend (1). This report summarizes an analysis of the increase in \\ngonorrhea in Colorado in 1992 and characterizes trends in the occurrence of \\nthis disease from 1985 through 1992. \\n     In 1992, 4679 cases of gonorrhea were reported to the Colorado Department \\nof Health (CDH) compared with 3901 cases reported in 1991. During 1992, \\nreported cases increased 22.7% and 17.5% among females and males, respectively \\n(Table 1). Similar increases occurred among blacks, whites, and Hispanics \\n(15.6%, 15.1%, and 15.9%, respectively); however, the number of reported cases \\nwith race not specified increased 88% from 1991 to 1992 and constituted 9.7% \\nof all reported cases in 1992. Although the largest proportional increases by \\nage groups occurred among persons aged 35-44 years (80.4%) and greater than or \\nequal to 45 years (87.7%), these age groups accounted for only 11.0% of all \\nreported cases in 1992. Persons in the 15-19-year age group accounted for the \\nlargest number of reported cases of gonorrhea during 1992 and the highest age \\ngroup-specific rate (639 per 100,000). \\n     Reported cases of gonorrhea increased 32.9% in the five-county Denver \\nmetropolitan area (1990 population: 1,629,466) but decreased elsewhere in the \\nstate (Table 1). Half the cases of gonorrhea in the Denver metropolitan area \\noccurred in 8.4% (34) of the census tracts; these represent neighborhoods \\nconsidered by sexually transmitted diseases (STDs)/acquired immunodeficiency \\nsyndrome (AIDS) field staff to be the focus of gang and drug activity. \\n     When compared with 1991, the number of gonorrhea cases diagnosed among \\nmen in the Denver Metro Health Clinic (DMHC, the primary public STD clinic in \\nthe Denver metropolitan area) increased 33% in 1992, and the number of visits \\nby males to the clinic increased 2.4%. Concurrently, the number of cases \\ndiagnosed among women increased by 1%. Among self-identified heterosexual men, \\nthe number of gonorrhea cases diagnosed at DMHC increased 33% and comprised \\n94% of all cases diagnosed in males, while the number of cases diagnosed among \\nself-identified homosexual men remained low (71 and 74 in 1991 and 1992, \\nrespectively). \\n     Four selected laboratories in the metropolitan Denver area (i.e., HMO, \\nuniversity hospital, nonprofit family planning, and commercial) were contacted \\nto determine whether gonorrhea culture-positivity rates increased. Gonorrhea \\nculture-positivity rates in three of four laboratories contacted increased \\n23%-33% from 1991 to 1992, while the rate was virtually unchanged in the \\nfourth (i.e., nonprofit family planning). \\n     From 1985 through 1991, reported cases of gonorrhea among whites and \\nHispanics in Colorado decreased; in comparison, reported cases among blacks \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 14\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\nincreased since 1988 (Figure 1). During 1988-1992, the population in Colorado \\nincreased 9.9% for blacks, 9.8% for Hispanics, and 4.5% for whites. In 1992, \\nthe gonorrhea rate for blacks (1935 per 100,000 persons) was 57 times that for \\nwhites (34 per 100,000) and 12 times that for Hispanics (156 per 100,000) \\n(Table 1). Among black females, reported cases of gonorrhea increased from \\n1988 through 1992 in the 15-19-year age group; among black males, cases \\nincreased from 1989 through 1992 in both the 15-19-and 20-24-year age groups. \\n\\nReported by: KA Gershman, MD, JM Finn, NE Spencer, MSPH, STD/AIDS Program; RE \\nHoffman, MD, State Epidemiologist, Colorado Dept of Health. JM Douglas, MD, \\nDenver Dept of Health and Hospitals. Surveillance and Information Systems Br, \\nDiv of Sexually Transmitted Diseases and HIV Prevention, National Center for \\nPrevention Svcs, CDC. \\n\\nEditorial Note: The increase in reported gonorrhea cases in Colorado in 1992 \\nmay represent an overall increase in the occurrence of this disease or more \\ncomplete reporting stimulated by visitations to laboratories by CDH \\nsurveillance staff during 1991-1992. The increases in confirmed gonorrhea \\ncases at DMHC and in culture-positivity rates in three of four laboratories \\nsuggest a real increase in gonorrhea rather than a reporting artifact. \\nHowever, the stable culture-positivity rate in the nonprofit family planning \\nlaboratory (which serves a network of clinics statewide) indicates that the \\ngonorrhea increase did not uniformly affect all segments of the population. \\n     One possible explanation for the increased occurrence of gonorrhea in \\nColorado may be gang- and drug-related sexual behavior, as implicated in a \\nrecent outbreak of drug-resistant gonorrhea and other STDs in Colorado Springs \\n(2). Although the high morbidity census tracts in the Denver metropolitan area \\ncoincide with areas of gang and drug activity, this hypothesis requires \\nfurther assessment. To examine the possible role of drug use -- implicated \\npreviously as a factor contributing to the national increase in syphilis (3-6) \\n-- the CDH STD/AIDS program is collecting information from all persons in whom \\ngonorrhea is diagnosed regarding drug use, exchange of sex for money or drugs, \\nand gang affiliation. \\n     The gonorrhea rate for blacks in Colorado substantially exceeds the \\nnational health objective for the year 2000 (1300 per 100,000) (objective \\n19.1a) (7). Race is likely a risk marker rather than a risk factor for \\ngonorrhea and other STDs. Risk markers may be useful for identifying groups at \\ngreatest risk for STDs and for targeting prevention efforts. Moreover, race-\\nspecific variation in STD rates may reflect differences in factors such as \\nsocioeconomic status, access to medical care, and high-risk behaviors. \\n     In response to the increased occurrence of gonorrhea in Colorado, \\ninterventions initiated by the CDH STD/AIDS program include 1) targeting \\npartner notification in the Denver metropolitan area to persons in groups at \\nincreased risk (e.g., 15-19-year-old black females and 20-24-year-old black \\nmales); 2) implementing a media campaign (e.g., public service radio \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 15\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\nannouncements, signs on city buses, newspaper advertisements, and posters in \\nschools and clinics) to promote awareness of STD risk and prevention targeted \\nprimarily at high-risk groups, and 3) developing teams of peer educators to \\nperform educational outreach in high-risk neighborhoods. The educational \\ninterventions are being developed and implemented with the assistance of \\nmembers of the target groups and with input from a forum of community leaders \\nand health-care providers. \\n\\nReferences\\n\\n1.

Child safety seats and safety \\nbelts can substantially reduce this loss (2). From 1977 through 1985, all 50 \\nstates passed legislation requiring the use of child safety seats or safety \\nbelts for children. Although these laws reduce injuries to young children by \\nan estimated 8%-59% (3,4), motor-vehicle crash-related injuries remain a major \\ncause of disability and death among U.S. children (1), while the use of \\noccupant restraints among children decreases inversely with age (84% usage for \\nthose aged 0-4 years; 57%, aged 5-11 years; and 29%, aged 12-18 years) (5). In \\naddition, parents who do not use safety belts themselves are less likely to \\nuse restraints for their children (6). To characterize the association between \\nadult safety-belt use and adult-reported consistent use of occupant restraints \\nfor the youngest child aged less than 11 years within a household, CDC \\nanalyzed data obtained from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System \\n(BRFSS) during 1988 and 1989. This report summarizes the findings from this \\nstudy. \\n     Data were available for 20,905 respondents aged greater than or equal to \\n18 years in 11 states * that participated in BRFSS -- a population-based, \\nrandom-digit-dialed telephone survey -- and administered a standard Injury \\nControl and Child Safety Module developed by CDC. Of these respondents, 5499 \\n(26%) had a child aged less than 11 years in their household. Each respondent \\nwas asked to specify the child's age and the frequency of restraint use for \\nthat child. The two categories of child restraint and adult safety-belt use in \\nthis analysis were 1) consistent use (i.e., always buckle up) and 2) less than \\nconsistent use (i.e., almost always, sometimes, rarely, or never buckle up). \\nData were weighted to provide estimates representative of each state. Software \\nfor Survey Data Analysis (SUDAAN) (7) was used to calculate point estimates \\nand confidence intervals. Statistically significant differences were defined \\nby p values of less than 0.05. \\n     Each of the 11 states had some type of child restraint law. Of these, six \\n(Arizona, Kentucky, Maine, Nebraska, Rhode Island, and West Virginia) had no \\nlaw requiring adults to use safety belts; four (Idaho, Maryland, Pennsylvania, \\nand Washington) had a secondary enforcement mandatory safety-belt law (i.e., a \\nvehicle had to be stopped for a traffic violation before a citation for nonuse \\nof safety belts could be issued); and one state (New York) had a primary \\nenforcement mandatory safety-belt law (i.e., vehicles could be stopped for a \\nsafety-belt law violation alone). In nine states, child-passenger protection \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 17\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\nlaws included all children aged less than 5 years, but the other two states \\nused both age and size of the child as criteria for mandatory restraint use. \\nThe analysis in this report subgrouped states into 1) those having a law \\nrequiring adult safety-belt use (law states), and 2) those without such a law \\n(no-law states). \\n     Overall, 21% of children aged less than 11 years reportedly were not \\nconsistently restrained during automobile travel. Both child restraint use and \\nadult restraint use were significantly higher (p less than 0.05, chi-square \\ntest) in law states than in no-law states (81.1% versus 74.3% and 58.7% versus \\n43.2%, respectively). \\n     High rates of restraint use for children aged less than or equal to 1 \\nyear were reported by both adults indicating consistent and less than \\nconsistent safety-belt use (Figure 1). Adults with consistent use reported \\nhigh rates of child-occupant restraint use regardless of the child's age \\n(range: 95.5% for 1-year-olds to 84.7% for 10-year-olds). In comparison, for \\nadults reporting less than consistent safety-belt use, the rate of child-\\noccupant restraint use declined sharply by the age of the child (range: 93.1% \\nfor 1-year-olds to 28.8% for 10-year-olds). When comparing children of \\nconsistent adult safety-belt users with children of less than consistent adult \\nsafety-belt users, 95% confidence intervals overlap for the two youngest age \\ngroups (i.e., aged less than 1 and 1 year). \\n     Reported child-occupant restraint use in law states generally exceeded \\nthat in no-law states, regardless of age of child (Table 1). In addition, \\nhigher adult educational attainment was significantly associated with \\nincreased restraint use for children, a factor that has also been associated \\nwith increased adult safety-belt use (8). \\n\\nReported by: National Center for Injury Prevention and Control; National \\nCenter for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, CDC. \\n\\nEditorial Note: The findings in this report are consistent with others \\nindicating that adults who do not use safety belts themselves are less likely \\nto employ occupant restraints for their children (6,9). Because these \\nnonbelted adults are at increased risk of crashing and more likely to exhibit \\nother risk-taking behaviors, children traveling with them may be at greater \\nrisk for motor-vehicle injury (10). \\n     Educational attainment of adult respondents was inversely associated with \\nchild restraint use in this report. Accordingly, occupant-protection programs \\nshould be promoted among parents with low educational attainment. Because low \\neducational attainment is often associated with low socioeconomic status, such \\nprograms should be offered to adults through health-care facilities that serve \\nlow-income communities or through federal programs (i.e., Head Start) that are \\ndirected at parents with young children. \\n     Injury-prevention programs emphasize restraining young children. In \\naddition, however, efforts must be intensified to protect child occupants as \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 18\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\nthey become older. Parents, especially those with low educational attainment, \\nthose who do not consistently wear safety belts, and those from states that do \\nnot have mandatory safety-belt use laws, should be encouraged to wear safety \\nbelts and to protect their children by using approved child safety seats and \\nsafety belts. Finally, the increased use of restraints among children may \\nincrease their likelihood of using safety belts when they become teenagers -- \\nthe age group characterized by the lowest rate of safety-belt use and the \\nhighest rate of fatal crashes (5). \\n\\nReferences\\n\\n1.

The \\nprevalence estimates for 44 diagnostic categories were based on data for 1983-\\n1988 for 639,837 births in California and 152,970 births in metropolitan \\nAtlanta. The prevalences in the two areas were compared, adjusting for race, \\nsex, and maternal age by using Poisson regression. \\n     Results: Regional differences in the prevalence of aortic stenosis, fetal \\nalcohol syndrome, hip dislocation/dysplasia, microcephalus, obstruction of the \\nkidney/ureter, and scoliosis/lordosis may be attributable to general \\ndiagnostic variability. However, differences in the prevalences of arm/hand \\nlimb reduction, encephalocele, spina bifida, or trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) are \\nprobably not attributable to differences in ascertainment, because these \\ndefects are relatively easy to diagnose. \\n     Interpretation: Regional differences in prenatal diagnosis and pregnancy \\ntermination may affect prevalences of trisomy 21 and spina bifida. However, \\nthe reason for differences in arm/hand reduction is unknown, but may be \\nrelated to variability in environmental exposure, heterogeneity in the gene \\npool, or random variation. \\n     Actions Taken: Because of the similarities of these data bases, several \\ncollaborative studies are being implemented. In particular, the differences in \\nthe birth prevalence of spina bifida and Down syndrome will focus attention on \\nthe impact of prenatal diagnosis.

Throughout the season increases in the indices \\nof influenza morbidity in regions where influenza A(H1N1) predominated were \\nsimilar to increases in regions where influenza B predominated. Only 7% of \\nidentified viruses were influenza A(H3N2), but isolations of this subtype \\nincreased as the season waned, and it subsequently predominated during the \\n1989-90 season. During the 1988-89 season outbreaks in nursing homes were \\nreported in association with influenza B and A(H3N2) but not influenza \\nA(H1N1). \\n     Interpretation: The alternating temporal and geographic predominance of \\ninfluenza strains A(H1N1) and B during the 1988-89 season emphasizes the \\nimportance of continual attention to regional viral strain surveillance, since \\namantadine is effective only for treatment and prophylaxis of influenza A. \\n     Actions Taken: Weekly interim analyses of surveillance data produced \\nthroughout the season allow physicians and public health officials to make \\ninformed choices regarding appropriate use of amantadine. CDC's annual \\nsurveillance allows the observed viral variants to be assessed as candidates \\nfor inclusion as components in vaccines used in subsequent influenza seasons. \\nAuthors: Louisa E.

Together, \\nthese technologies are referred to as the high-tech assisted reproductive \\ntechnology (ART) procedures. \\n\\nOvulation induction, sperm insemination and surgery for tubal disease and/or \\npathology still are the mainstays of the therapies available for infertility \\nmanagement. However, when these fail, it almost always is appropriate to \\nproceed with one of the ART procedures. \\n\\nTherefore, in addition to a comprehensive basic and general infertility \\nservice at The University of Arizona Center for Reproductive Endocrinology and \\nInfertility, there is a program of Assisted Reproduction that specializes in \\nART procedures. This program serves as a tertiary provider for those patients \\nin the state of Arizona whose infertility problems cannot be resolved by the \\ntraditional therapies. \\n\\nThe following article (on back) describes the ART procedures available in our \\nCenter, clarifies appropriate applications for each, and considers the \\nrealistic expectations for their success. Procedures included are: \\n\\no in vitro \\no fertilization - embryo transfer (IVF-ET),  gamete intrafallopian tube \\n  transfer \\no (GIFT),  cryopreservation of human embryos and  gamete micromanipulation. \\nThis article also considers ongoing research in our program that is directed \\ntowards improved success of these technologies. \\n\\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 24\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\n                           Future Areas of Research\\n\\nIn addition to ongoing research that is directed exclusively toward the \\nmanagement of infertile couples, we are developing the technology to assist \\ncouples who are at risk for producing embryos with a serious hereditary \\ndisease. \\n\\nThis technology involves biopsying the preimplantation human embryo and then \\nsubjecting the biopsied cells to genetic analysis using either DNA \\namplification or fluorescent in situ hybridization. \\n\\nThere are recent reports of the successful application of DNA amplification by \\nother centers, for example, for diagnosis of the genes for cystic fibrosis and \\nhemophilia. We hope to apply and further focus fluorescent in situ \\nhybridization technology for probing the X chromosome, the identification of \\nwhich will provide a scientific basis for counselling patients who exhibit \\nsex-linked disorders. \\n\\nThe considerable clinical application of such technology lies in the fact that \\nit circumvents the need for prenatal diagnosis, in addition to the possibility \\nof a subsequent termination of affected fetuses, in order to avoid the birth \\nof affected children. \\n\\n\\nCatherine Racowsky, Ph.D.\\nAssociate Professor and Director of Research\\nDepartment of Obstetrics and Gynecology\\nCollege of Medicine \\nUniversity of Arizona\\nTucson, Arizona\\n\\n               Applications, Success Rates and Advances for the\\n                           Management of Infertility\\n\\nThe following are the ART procedures available at The University of Arizona \\nCenter for Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility. \\n\\n     In Vitro Fertilization - Embryo Transfer is the core ART procedure of our \\nAssisted Reproduction Program.  This procedure involves retrieval of \\nunfertilized eggs from the ovary, their insemination in vitro in a dish, and \\nthe culture of resultant embryos for 1 or 2 days, before they are transferred \\nto the patient's uterus. All cultures are maintained in an incubator under \\nstrictly controlled atmospheric and temperature conditions. Before being \\nprocessed for use in insemination, semen samples are evaluated in our \\nandrology laboratory using both subjective light microscopy and computer-\\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 25\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\nassisted semen analyses. To ensure an adequate number of eggs with which to \\nperform IVF-ET, or indeed, GIFT, follicular development is typically \\nstimulated, with gonadotropins (perganol, metrodin), gonadotropin releasing \\nhormone (GnRH, Factrel, lutrepulse) and/or GnRH analogues (lupron, Depo \\nlupron, synarel). Occasionally, however, IVF-ET is accomplished with eggs \\nobtained in non-stimulated cycles. While some programs utilize laparoscopic \\negg retrieval in the operating room with the patient under general anesthesia, \\nwe undertake the less costly approach of ultrasound-guided retrieval in our \\nInfertility Unit, with the patient sedated.  \\n     Couples who resort to IVF-ET exhibit such pathologies as tubal \\ndeficiencies, ovulatory dysfunction, endometriosis, and/or mild forms of male \\nfactor infertility.  According to the United States IVF Registry, the overall \\nsuccess rate for IVF-ET nationwide has stabilized at about 14 percent per \\ncycle. Results from our program, involving 86 patients who have undergone 173 \\nIVF-ET cycles, reflect a comparable success rate. \\n     Nevertheless, the overall incidence of success with this procedure is \\ndisconcertingly low and emphasizes the need to address those physiological \\nfactors that limit achievement of a higher percentage of pregnancies.  Well \\nrecognized predictors of outcome include patient age, response to exogenous \\novarian stimulation, quality of sperm and number of repeated IVF-ET cycle \\nattempts. However, among these, age is the single most significant determinant \\nof conception. Therefore, it is critical that such patients are referred to an \\nAssisted Reproduction Program at the earliest opportunity following failure of \\ntraditional therapies. \\n     The underlying basis for the negative effect of age on fertility has not \\nbeen clearly delineated beyond recognition that: 1) the number of eggs \\navailable for retrieval declines markedly with age; 2) fertilization rates \\nsignificantly decrease in eggs retrieved from patients who are over 40 years; \\nand 3) provided the appropriate hormonal background is present, age is \\nunrelated to uterine competency to sustain pregnancy. Ongoing research in our \\nCenter, therefore, is investigating physiological changes in the egg that may \\nbe impacted by age. We have determined that more than 50 percent of eggs that \\nfail to fertilize in vitro are chromosomally abnormal, and that a significant \\nproportion of these abnormalities are accountable to patient age. Currently, \\nthe only recourse for such patients is to use eggs obtained from a donor. Our \\nprogram has initiated recruitment of volunteer egg donors to satisfy the needs \\nof a list of recipients interested in this form of therapy. \\n\\n     GIFT - This high-tech ART procedure is performed in the operating room, \\nusually with the use of a laparoscope and, in contrast to IVF-ET, involves \\nintroducing sperm and freshly retrieved eggs into the lumen of the Fallopian \\ntube (an average of 3 eggs/tube). Under these circumstances, fertilization \\noccurs in vivo and, if excess eggs are retrieved, the remainder undergo IVF, \\nwith subsequent options for embryo transfer in that cycle, or freezing for \\ntransfer in a subsequent cycle. This ART procedure is applied to cases in \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 26\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\nwhich there is at least one patent Fallopian tube but the couple has such \\npathologies as ovulatory dysfunction, endometriosis, male factor infertility \\nand/or idiopathic infertility.    \\n     The data reported in the United States IVF Registry for 1985 through 1990 \\nindicate that the overall success rate with GIFT is higher than that obtained \\nwith the IVF-ET technique (range of clinical pregnancies for GIFT is 24 to 36 \\npercent and for IVF-ET 14 to 18 percent). In view of this fact, one might \\nexpect more patients to be treated with GIFT than IVF-ET. However, in our \\nprogram we have taken into account three basic concerns which, while \\nsubstantially reducing the number of GIFT cycles performed, benefit the \\npatient. These concerns are: 1) the increased costs associated with performing \\na procedure in the operating room; 2) the risks, albeit minimal, of undergoing \\ngeneral anesthesia; and 3) the considerable benefits to be accrued from \\nobtaining direct information on the quality and fertilizability of the eggs, \\nand the developmental competency of resultant embryos. \\n     The increased success with GIFT undoubtedly reflects the artificial \\nenvironment provided by the laboratory in the IVF-ET procedure. Between \\nJanuary 1, 1991, and December 31, 1992, we have performed a total of 12 GIFT \\ncycles, with an overall success rate of 20 percent. \\n     Embryo cryopreservation, or freezing, is applied in our program when \\nembryos result from residual GIFT eggs or from non-transferred IVF embryos. \\nThis procedure not only provides patients with a subsequent opportunity for \\nsuccess at much reduced costs, but also circumvents the legal and ethical \\nissues relating to disposal of supernumerary embryos. Therefore, as stipulated \\nby the American Fertility Society ethical guidelines for ART programs, from \\nboth a practical and an ethical standpoint, all Assisted Reproduction programs \\nshould have the capability of cryopreserving human embrys. \\n     Gamete Micromanipulation - This ART procedure, which is still very new, \\nis applied to couples who are unaccepting of insemination with donor semen but \\nwho have severe male factor infertility (less than 10 million sperm/ml in \\ncombination with fewer than 20 perccent motile sperm, and/or less than 10 \\npercent sperm with normal morphology). We are currently developing the \\nprocedure of sub-zonal insertion (SZI), which entails injecting sperm under \\nthe coating around the egg, the barrier normally penetrated by the sperm \\nthrough enzymatic digestion. \\n     Available data from SZI programs world-wide indicate that only 5 to 10 \\npercent of SZI cycles result in a pregnancy. This statistic undoubtedly \\nrelates to limitations imposed by abnormalities inherent in the sperm. \\nTherefore, we are currently focusing on the development of improved techniques \\nfor the recognition and selection of sperm chosen for manipulation. Such \\nefforts are unquestionably worthwhile in view of the fact that this technology \\noffers the only realistic opportunity for severe male factor patients to \\nestablish conception. \\n\\nCatherine Racowsky, Ph.D.\\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 27\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\nAssociate Professor and Director of Research\\nDepartment of Obstetrics and Gynecology\\nCollege of Medicine \\n--------- end of part 2 ------------\\n\",\n",

I tried to decide on paper what pixels go where, and failed.\\nHas anyone come up with method for mapping a planar to crosswise sheared\\nshape?\\n\\nCurrently I take:\\n\\n  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16\\n 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32\\n 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48\\n 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64\\n\\nand produce:\\n            \\n             1  2  3  4\\n33 34 35 36 17 18 19 20  5  6  7  8\\n49 50 51 52 37 38 39 40 21 22 23 24  9 10 11 12\\n            53 54 55 56 41 42 43 44 25 26 27 28 13 14 15 16\\n                        57 58 59 60 45 46 47 48 29 30 31 32\\n                                    61 62 63 64\\n\\nLine 1 follows the slope.

Has anyone come up with a better way?\\nPerhaps it is necessary to simply draw the original bitmap\\nalready skewed?\\n\\nAre there any other particularly sticky problems with this perspective?\\nI was planning on having hidden plane removal by using z-buffering.\\nLocations are stored in (x,y,z) form.\\n\\n[*] For those of you who noticed, the top lines of wall 2 (and wall 1)\\n*are* parallel with its bottom lines.  This is why there appears to\\nbe an optical illusion (ie. it appears to be either the inside or outside\\nof a cube, depending on your mood).  There are no vanishing points.\\nThis simplifies the drawing code for objects (which don\\'t have to\\nchange size as they move about in the room).  I\\'ve decided that this\\napproximation is alright, since small displacements at a large enough\\ndistance cause very little change in the apparent size of an object in\\na real perspective drawing.\\n\\nHopefully the \"context\" of the picture (ie. chairs on the floor, torches\\nhanging on the walls) will dispell any visual ambiguity.\\n\\nThanks in advance for any help.\\n',\n",

They left and I had an attack. I realized that the dan-\\nger was past, and stopped controlling myself. I relaxed for a moment and the \\nphysical pain immediately made itself felt. My heart and kidneys hurt. I had \\nan awful kidney attack. I rolled back and forth on top of those Christmas\\nornaments, howling and howling. I didn\\'t know where I was or how long this \\nwent on. When we figured out the time, later it turned out that I howled and \\nwas in pain for around an hour. Then all my strength was gone and I burst into\\ntears, I started feeling sorry for myself, and so on and so forth . . .\\n\\nThen someone came into the room. I think I hear someone calling my name. I \\nwant to respond and restrain myself, I think that I\\'m hallucinating. I am \\nsilent, and then it continues: it seems that first a man\\'s voice is calling\\nme, then a woman\\'s. Later I found out that Mamma had sent our neighbor, the\\none whose apartment she was hiding in, Uncle Sabir Kasumov, to our place, \\ntelling him, \"I know that they\\'ve killed Lyuda. Go there and at least bring \\nher corpse to me so they don\\'t violate her corpse.\" He went and returned empty\\nhanded, but Mamma thought he just didn\\'t want to carry the corpse into his \\napartment. She sent him another time, and then sent his wife, and they were \\nwalking through the rooms looking for me, but I didn\\'t answer their calls. \\nThere was no light, they had smashed the chandeliers and lamps.\\n\\nThey started the pogrom in our apartment around five o\\'clock, and at 9:30 I \\nwent down to the Kasumovs\\'. I went down the stairs myself. I walked out of the\\napartment: how long can you wait for your own death, how long can you be \\ncowardly, afraid? Come what will. I walked out and started knocking on the \\ndoors one after the next. No one, not on the fifth floor, not on the fourth, \\nopened the door. On the third floor, on the landing of the stairway, Uncle \\nSabir\\'s son started to shout, \"Aunt Roza, don\\'t cry, Lyuda\\'s alive!\" He \\nknocked on his own door and out came Aunt Tanya, Igor, and after them, Mamma. \\nAunt Tanya, Uncle Sabir\\'s wife, is an Urdmurt. All of us were in their \\napartment. I didn\\'t see Karina, but she was in their home, too, Lying\\ndelirious, she had a fever. Marina was there too, and my father and mother.\\nAll of my family had gathered there.\\n   \\nAt the door I lost consciousness. Igor and Aunt Tanya carried me into the\\napartment.\\n\\nLater I found out what they had done to our Karina. Mamma said, \"Lyuda, \\nKarina\\'s in really serious condition, she\\'s probably dying. If she recognizes \\nyou, don\\'t cry, don\\'t tell her that her face looks so awful.\" It was as though\\nher whole face was paralyzed, you know, everything was pushed over to one \\nside, her eye was all swollen, and everything flowed together, her lips, her \\ncheeks . . . It was as though they had dragged her right side around the whole\\nmicrodistrict, that\\'s how disfigured her face was. I said, \"Fine.\" Mamma was \\nafraid to go into the room, because she went in and hugged Karina and started \\nto cry. I went in. As soon as I saw her my legs gave way. I fell down near the\\nbed, hugged her legs and started kissing them and crying. She opened the eye \\nthat was intact, looked at me, and said, \"Who is it?\" But I could barely talk, \\nmy whole face was so badly beaten. I didn\\'t say, but rather muttered something\\ntender, something incomprehensible, but tender, \"My Karochka, my Karina, my \\nlittle golden one . . . \" She understood me.\\n\\nThen Igor brought me some water, I drank it down and moistened Karina\\'s lips. \\nShe started to groan. She was saying something to me, but I couldn\\'t \\nunderstand it. Then I made out, \"It hurts, I hurt all over.\" Her hair was \\nglued down with blood. I stroked her forehead, her head, she had grit on her \\nforehead, and on her lips . . . She was groaning again, and I don\\'t know how \\nto help her. She calls me over with her hand, come closer. I go to her. She\\'s\\nsaying something to me, but I can\\'t understand her. Igor brings her a pencil \\nand paper and says, \"Write it down.\" She shakes her head as if to say, no, I \\ncan\\'t write. I can\\'t understand what she\\'s saying. She wanted to tell me \\nsomething, but she couldn\\'t. I say, \"Karina, just lie there a little while,\\nthen maybe you\\'ll feel better and you can tell me then.\" And then she says,\\n\"Maybe it\\'ll be too late.\" And I completely . . . just broke down, I couldn\\'t\\ncontrol myself.\\n\\nThen I moistened my hand in the water and wiped her forehead and eye. I dipped\\na handkerchief into the water and squeezed a little water onto her lips. She \\nsays, \"Lyuda, we\\'re not saved yet, we have to go somewhere else. Out of this \\ndamned house. They want to kill us, I know. They\\'ll find us here, too. We need\\nto call Urshan.\" She repeated this to me for almost a whole hour, Until I \\nunderstood her every word. I ask, \"What\\'s his number?\" Urshan Feyruzovich, \\nthat\\'s the head of the administration where she works. \"We have to call him.\" \\nBut I didn\\'t know his home number. I say, \"Karina, what\\'s his number?\" She \\nsays, \"I can\\'t remember.\" I say, \"Who knows his number? Who can I call?\" She \\nsays, \"I don\\'t know anything, leave me alone.\"\\n\\nI went out of the room. Igor stayed to watch over her and sat there, he was \\ncrying, too. I say, \"Mamma, Karina says that we have to call Urshan. How can \\nwe call him? Who knows his telephone number?\" I tell Marina, \"Think, think, \\nwho can we call to find out?\" She started calling; several people didn\\'t \\nanswer. She called a girlfriend, her girlfriend called another girlfriend and \\nfound out the number and called us back. The boss\\'s wife answered and said he \\nwas at the dacha. My voice keeps cracking, I can\\'t talk normally. She says, \\n\"Lyuda, don\\'t panic, get a hold of yourself, go out to those hooligans and \\ntell them that they just can\\'t do that.\" She still didn\\'t know what was really\\ngoing on. I said, \"It\\'s easy for you to say that, you don\\'t understand what\\'s \\nhappening. They are killing people here. I don\\'t think there is a single \\nArmenian left in the building, they\\'ve cut them all up. I\\'m even surprised \\nthat we managed to save ourselves. \"She says, \"Well, OK, if it\\'s that serious \\n. . . \" And all the same she\\'s thinking that my emotions are all churned up \\nand that I\\'m fearing for my life, that in fact it\\'s not all that bad. \"OK, \\nfine, fine,\" she says, \"if you\\'re afraid, OK, as soon as Urshan comes back \\nI\\'ll send him over.\"\\n\\nWe called again because they had just started robbing the apartment directly \\nunder Aunt Tanya\\'s, on the second floor, Asya Dallakian\\'s apartment. She \\nwasn\\'t home, she was staying with her daughter in Karabagh. They destroyed \\neverything there . . . We realized that they still might come back. We kept on\\ntrying to get through to Aunt Tanya--Urshan\\'s wife is named Tanya too and \\nfinally we get through. She says, \"Yes, he\\'s come home, he\\'s leaving for your \\nplace now.\" He came. Of course he didn\\'t know what was happening, either, \\nbecause he brought two of his daughters with him. He came over in his jeep \\nwith his two daughters, like he was going on an outing. He came and saw what \\nshape we were in and what was going on in town and got frightened. He has \\ngrown up daughters, they\\'re almost my age.\\n\\nThe three of us carried out Karina, tossed a coat on her and a warm scarf, and\\nwent down to his car. He took Karina and me to the Maternity Home. . . No, \\nfirst they took us to the po]ice precinct. They had stretchers ready. As\\nsoon as we got out of the car they put Karina and me on stretchers and said\\nthat we were in serious condition and that we mustn\\'t move, we might have\\nfractures. From the stretcher I saw about 30 soldiers sitting and lying on the\\nfirst floor, bandaged, on the concrete floor, groaning . . . This was around\\neleven o\\'clock at night. We had left the house somewhere around 1:30. When I \\nsaw those soldiers I realized that a war was going on: soldiers, enemies\\n. . . everything just like a war.\\n\\nThey carried me into some office on the stretcher. The emergency medical\\npeople from Baku were there. The medical attendant there was an older \\nArmenian. Urshan told him what they had done to Karina because she\\'s so proud \\nshe would never have told. And this aging Armenian . . . his name was Uncle \\nArkady, I think, because someone said \"Arkady, get an injection ready,\" he \\nstarted to fill a syringe, and turned around so as to give Karina a shot. But \\nwhen he looked at her face he became ill. And he was an old man, in his \\nsixties, his hair was all grey, and his moustache, too. He hugged Karina and \\nstarted to cry: \"What have they done to you?!\" He was speaking Armenian. \"What\\nhave they done to you?!\" Karina didn\\'t say anything. Mamma came in then, and \\nshe started to cry, too. The man tried to calm her. \"I\\'ll give you a shot.\" \\nMamma tells him, \"I don\\'t need any shot. Where is the government? Just what \\nare they doing? Look what they\\'ve done to my children! They\\'re killing people,\\nand you\\'re just sitting here!\" Some teacups were standing on the table in \\nthere. \"You\\'re sitting here drinking tea! Look what they\\'ve done to my \\ndaughters! Look what they\\'ve turned them into!\" They gave her something to \\ndrink, some heart medicine, I think. They gave Karina an injection and the\\ndoctor said that she had to be taken to the Maternity Home immediately. Papa \\nand Urshan, I think, even though Papa was in bad shape, helped carry Karina \\nout. When they put her on the stretcher, none of the medics got near her. I \\ndon\\'t know, maybe there weren\\'t any orderlies. Then they came to me: \"What\\'s \\nthe matter with you?\" Their tone was so official that I wrapped myself tighter\\nin the half-length coat. I had a blanket on, too, an orange one, Aunt Tanya\\'s.\\nI said, \"I\\'m fine.\" Uncle Arkady came over and was soothing me, and then told \\nthe doctor, \"You leave, let a woman examine her.\" A woman came, an \\nAzerbaijani, I believe, and said, \"What\\'s wrong with you?\" I was wearing my \\nsister Lyuda\\'s nightshirt, the sister who at this time was in Yerevan. When \\nshe was nursing her infant she had cut out a big hole in it so that it would \\nbe easier to breast feed the baby. I tore the night shirt some more and showed\\nher. I took it off my shoulders and turned my back to her. There was a huge \\nwound, about the size of a hand, on my back, from the Indian vase. She said \\nsomething to them and they gave me two shots. She said that it should be \\ndressed with something, but that they\\'d do that in the hospital.\\n\\nThey put me on a stretcher, too. They started looking for people to carry me. \\nI raised up my head a little and wanted to sit up, and this woman, I don\\'t \\nknow if she was a doctor or a nurse, said, \"Lie still, you mustn\\'t move.\" When\\nI was lying back down I saw two policemen leading a man. His profile seemed \\nvery familiar to me. I shouted, \"Stop!\" One of the policemen turned and says, \\n\"What do you want?\" I say, \"Bring him to me, I want to look at him.\" They \\nbrought him over and I said, \"That person was just in our apartment and he \\njust raped me and my sister. I recognize him, note it down.\" They said, \\n\"Fine,\" but didn\\'t write it down and led him on. I don\\'t know where they were \\ntaking him.\\n\\nThen they put my stretcher near where the injured and beaten soldiers were \\nsitting. They went to look for the ambulance driver so he would bring the car \\nup closer. One of the soldiers started talking to me, \"Sister . . . \" I don\\'t \\nremember the conversation exactly, but he asked me were we lived and what they\\ndid to us. I asked him, \"Where are you from?\" He said that he was from Ufa. \\nApparently they were the first that were brought in. The Ufa police. Later I \\nlearned that they suffered most of all. He says, \"OK, you\\'re Armenians, they \\ndidn\\'t get along with you, but I\\'m a Russian,\" he says, \"what are they trying \\nto kill me for?\" Oh, I remembered something else. When I went out onto the \\nbalcony with Kuliyev for a hammer and nails I looked out the window and saw \\ntwo Azerbaijanis beating a soldier near the kindergarten. He was pressed \\nagainst the fence and he covered his head with his arms, they were beating him\\nwith his own club. The way he cried \"Mamma\" made my skin crawl. I don\\'t know \\nwhat they did to him, if he\\'s still alive or not. And something else. Before \\nhe attack on our house we saw sheets, clothes, and some dishes flying from the\\nthird or fourth floor of the neighboring building, but I didn\\'t think it was \\nAzerbaijanis attacking Armenians. I thought that something was on fire or they\\nwere throwing something they didn\\'t need out, or someone was fighting with \\nsomeone. It was only later, when they were burning a passenger car in the \\nyard, when the neighbors said that they were doing that to the Armenians, that\\nI realized that this was serious, that it was anti-Armenian.\\n\\nThey took Karina and me to the Sumgait Maternity Home. Mamma went to them too \\nand said, \"I\\'ve been beaten too, help me.\" But they just ignored her. My \\nfather went to them and said in a guilty voice, as though it was his fault \\nthat he\\'d been beaten, and says, \"My ribs hurt so much, those creeps have \\nprobably broken my ribs. Please look at them.\" The doctor says, \"That\\'s not my\\njob.\" Urshan said, \"Fine, I\\'ll take you to my place and if we need a doctor, \\nI\\'ll find you one. I\\'ll bring one and have him look at you. And he drove them \\nto his apartment.\\n\\nMarina and I stayed there. They examined us. I was more struck by what the \\ndoctor said than by what those Azerbaijanis in our apartment did to us. I \\nwasn\\'t surprised when they beat us they wanted to beat us, but I was very\\nsurprised that in a Soviet medical facility a woman who had taken the\\nHippocratic Oath could talk to victims like that. By happy--or unhappy--\\ncoincidence we were seen by the doctor that had delivered our Karina. And she,\\nhaving examined Karina, said, \"No problem, you got off pretty good. Not like \\nthey did in Kafan, when you Armenians were killing and raping our women.\\n\"Karina was in such terrible condition that she couldn\\'t say anything--she\\nwould certainly have had something to say! Then they examined me. The same \\nstory. They put us in a separate ward. No shots, no medicinal powders, no \\ndrugs. Absolutely none! They didn\\'t even give us tea. All the women there soon\\nfound out that in ward such and such were Armenians who had been raped. And\\nthey started coming and peering through the keyhole, the way people look at \\nzoo animals. Karina didn\\'t see this, she was lying there, and I kept her from \\nseeing it.\\n\\nThey put Ira B. in our ward. She had also been raped. True, she didn\\'t have \\nany serious bodily injuries, but when she told me what had happened at their \\nplace, I felt worse for them than I did for us. Because when they raped Ira \\nher daughter was in the room, she was under the bed on which it happened. And\\nIra was holding her daughter\\'s hand, the one who was hiding under the bed.\\nWhen they were beating Ira or taking her earrings off, gold, when she \\ninvoluntarily let go of her daughter\\'s hand, her daughter took her hand again.\\nHer daughter is in the fourth grade, she\\'s 11 years old. I felt really awful \\nwhen I heard that. Ira asked them not to harm her daughter, she said, \"Do what\\nyou want with me, just leave my daughter alone.\" Well, they did what they \\nwanted. They threatened to kill her daughter if she got in their way. Now I \\nwould be surprised if the criminals had behaved any other way that night. It \\nwas simply Bartholomew\\'s Night, I say, they did what they would love to do \\nevery day: steal, kill, rape . . .\\n\\nMany are surprised that those animals didn\\'t harm the children. The beasts \\nexplained it like this: this would be repeated in 15 to 20 years, and those \\nchildren would be grown, and then, as they put it, \"we\\'ll come take the \\npleasure out of their lives, those children.\" This was about the girls that\\nwould be young women in 15 years. They were thinking about their tomorrow \\nbecause they were sure that there would be no trial and no investigation, just\\nas there was no trial or investigation in 1915, and that those girls could be \\nof some use in 15 years. This I heard from the investigators; one of the \\nvictims testified to it. That\\'s how they described their own natures, that\\nthey would still be bloodthirsty in 15 to 20 years, and in 100 years--they\\nthemselves said that.\\n\\nAnd this, too. Everyone is surprised that they didn\\'t harm our Marina. Many \\npeople say that they either were drunk or had smoked too much. I don\\'t know \\nwhy their eyes were red. Maybe because they hadn\\'t slept the night before, \\nmaybe for some other reason, I don\\'t know. But they hadn\\'t been smoking and \\nthey weren\\'t drunk, I\\'m positive, because someone who has smoked will stop at \\nnothing he has the urge to do. And they spoke in a cultured fashion with \\nMarina: \"Little sister, don\\'t be afraid, we won\\'t harm you, don\\'t look over \\nthere [where I was], you might be frightened. You\\'re a Muslim, a Muslim woman \\nshouldn\\'t see such things.\" So they were really quite sober . . .\\n\\nSo we came out of that story alive. Each every day we have lived since it all \\nhappened bears the mark of that day. It wasn\\'t even a day, of those several \\nhours. Father still can\\'t look us in the eyes. He still feels guilty for what\\nhappened to Karina, Mother, and me. Because of his nerves he\\'s started talk-\\ning to himself, I\\'ve heard him argue with himself several times when he\\nthought no one is listening: \"Listen,\" he\\'ll say, \"what could I do? What could\\nI do alone, how could I protect them?\" I don\\'t know where to find the words,\\nit\\'s not that I\\'m happy, but I am glad that he didn\\'t see it all happen. \\nThat\\'s the only thing they spared us . . . or maybe it happened by chance. Of \\ncourse he knows it all, but there\\'s no way you could imagine every last detail\\nof what happened. And there were so many conversations: Karina and I spoke\\ntogether in private, and we talked with Mamma, too. But Father was never\\npresent at those conversations. We spare him that, if you can say that. And\\nwhen the investigator comes to the house, we don\\'t speak with Father present.\\n\\nOn February 29, the next clay, Karina and I were discharged from the hospital.\\nFirst they released me, but since martial law had been declared in the city, \\nthe soldiers took me to the police precinct in an armored personnel carrier. \\nThere were many people there, Armenian victims. I met the Tovmasian family \\nthere. From them I learned that Rafik and their Uncle Grant had died. They \\nwere sure that both had died. They were talking to me and Raya, Rafik\\'s wife \\nand Grant\\'s daughter, and her mother, were both crying.\\n\\nThen they took us all out of the office on the first floor into the yard.\\nThere\\'s a little one-room house outside there, a recreation and reading area.\\nThey took us in there. The women were afraid to go because they thought\\nthat they were shooing us out of the police precinct because it had become\\nso dangerous that even the people working at the precinct wanted to hide.\\nThe women were shouting. They explained to them: \"We want to hide you\\nbetter because it\\'s possible there will be an attack on the police precinct.\"\\n\\nWe went into the little house. There were no chairs or tables in there. We\\nhad children with us and they were hungry; we even had infants who needed to \\nhave their diapers changed. No one had anything with them. It was just awful. \\nThey kept us there for 24 hours. From the window of the one room house you \\ncould see that there were Azerbaijanis standing on the fences around the \\npolice precinct, as though they were spying on us. The police precinct is \\nsurrounded by a wall, like a fence, and it\\'s electrified, but if they were \\nstanding on the wall, it means the electricity was shut off. This brought \\ngreat psychological pressure to bear on us, particularly on those who hadn\\'t \\njust walked out of their apartments, but who hadn\\'t slept for 24 hours, or 48,\\nor those who had suffered physically and spiritually, the ones who had lost \\nfamily members. For us it was another ordeal. We were especially frightened \\nwhen all the precinct employees suddenly disappeared. We couldn\\'t see a single\\nperson, not in the courtyard and not in the windows. We thought that they must\\nhave already been hiding under the building, that they must have some secret \\nroom down there. People were panicking: they started throwing themselves at\\none another . . . That\\'s the way it is on a sinking ship. We heard those \\npeople, mainly young people, whistling and whopping on the walls. We felt that\\nthe end was approaching. I was completely terrified: I had left Karina in the \\nhospital and didn\\'t know where my parents were. I was sort of calm about my \\nparents, I was thinking only about Karina, if, Heaven forbid, they should \\nattack the hospital, they would immediately tell them that there was an \\nArmenian in there, and something terrible would happen to Karina again, and \\nshe wouldn\\'t be able to take it.\\n\\nThen soldiers with dogs appeared. When they saw the dogs some of the people \\nclimbed down off the fence. Then they brought in about another 30 soldiers.\\nThey all had machine guns in readiness, their fingers on the triggers. We \\ncalmed down a little. They brought us chairs and brought the children some \\nlittle cots and showed us where we could wash our hands, and took the children\\nto the toilet. But we all sat there hungry, but to be honest, it would never \\nhave occurred to any of us that we hadn\\'t eaten for two days and that people \\ndo eat.\\n\\nThen, closer to nightfall, they brought a group of detained criminals. They \\nwere being watched by soldiers with guard dogs. One of the men came back from \\nthe courtyard and told us about it. Raya Tovmasian . . . it was like a \\ndifferent woman had been substituted. Earlier she had been crying, wailing, \\nand calling out: \"Oh, Rafik!,\" but when she heard about this such a rage came \\nover her! She jumped up, she had a coat on, and she started to roll up her \\nsleeves like she was getting ready to beat someone. And suddenly there were \\nsoldiers, and dogs, and lots of people. She ran over to them. The bandits were\\nstanding there with their hands above their heads facing the wall. She went up\\nto one of them and grabbed him by the collar and started to shake and thrash \\nhim! Then, on to a second, and a third. Everyone was rooted to the spot. Not \\none of the soldiers moved, no one went up to help or made her stop her from \\ndoing it. And the bandits fell down and covered their heads with their hands, \\nmuttering something. She came back and sat down, and something akin to a smile\\nappeared on her face. She became so quiet: no tears, no cries. Then that round\\nwas over and she went back to beat them again. She was walking and cursing \\nterribly: take that, and that, they killed my husband, the bastards, the \\ncreeps, and so on. Then she came back again and sat down. She probably did \\nthis the whole night through, well, it wasn\\'t really night, no one slept. She \\nwent five or six times and beat them and returned. And she told the women, \\n\"What are you sitting there for? They killed your husbands and children, they \\nraped, and you\\'re just sitting there. You\\'re sitting and talking as though \\nnothing had happened. Aren\\'t you Armenians?\" She appealed to everyone, but no \\none got up. I was just numb, I didn\\'t have the strength to beat anyone, I \\ncould barely hold myself up, all the more so since I had been standing for so \\nmany hours--I was released at eleven o\\'clock in the morning and it was already\\nafter ten at night because there weren\\'t enough chairs, really it was the \\nelderly and women with children who sat. I was on my feet the whole time. \\nThere was nothing to breathe, the door was closed, and the men were smoking. \\nThe situation was deplorable.\\n\\nAt eleven o\\'clock at night policemen came for us, local policemen, \\nAzerbaijanis. They said, \"Get up. They\\'ve brought mattresses, you can wash up\\nand put the children to bed.\" Now the women didn\\'t want to leave this place, \\neither. The place had become like home, it was safe, there were soldiers with \\ndogs. If anyone went outside, the soldiers would say, \"Oh, it\\'s our little \\nfamily,\" and things like that. The soldiers felt this love, and probably, for \\nthe first time in their lives perceived themselves as defenders. Everyone\\nspoke from the heart, cried, and hugged them and they, with their loaded\\nmachine guns in their hands, said, \"Grandmother, you mustn\\'t approach me,\\nI\\'m on guard.\" Our people would say, \"Oh, that\\'s all right.\" They hugged\\nthem, one woman even kissed one of the machine guns. This was all terribly\\nmoving for me. And the small children kept wanting to pet the dogs.\\n\\nThey took us up to the second floor and said, \"You can undress and sleep in \\nhere. Don\\'t be afraid, the precinct is on guard, and it\\'s quiet in the city.\"\\nThis was the 29th, when the killing was going on in block 41A and in other\\nplaces. Then we were told that all the Armenians were being gathered at the\\nSK club and at the City Party Committee. They took us there. On the way I \\nasked them to stop at the Maternity Home: I wanted to take Karina with me.\\nI didn\\'t know what was happening there. They told me, \"Don\\'t worry, the\\nMaternity Home is full of soldiers, more than mothers-to-be. So you can rest\\nassured. I say, \"Well, I won\\'t rest assured regardless, because the staff in\\nthere is capable of anything.\"\\n\\nWhen I arrived at the City Party Committee it turned out that Karina had\\nalready been brought there. They had seen fit to release her from the hospi-\\ntal, deciding that she felt fine and was no longer in need of any care. Once\\nwe were in the City Party Committee we gave free reign to our tears. We met \\nacquaintances, but everyone was somehow divided into two groups, those who \\nhadn\\'t been injured, who were clothed, who had brought a pot of food with \\nthem, and so on, and those, like me, like Raya, who were wearing whatever had \\ncome their way. There were even people who were all made up, dolled up like \\nthey had come from a wedding. There were people without shoes, naked people, \\nhungry people, those who were crying, and those who had lost someone. And of \\ncourse the stories and the talk were flying: \"Oh, I heard that they killed \\nhim!\" \"What do you mean they killed him!\" \"He stayed at work!\" \"Do you know \\nwhat\\'s happening at this and such a plant? Talk like that.\\n\\nAnd then I met Aleksandr Mikhailovich Gukasian, the teacher. I know him very \\nwell and respect him highly. I\\'ve known him for a long time. They had a small \\nroom, well really it was more like a study-room. We spent a whole night \\ntalking in that study once. On March 1 we heard that Bagirov [First Secretary \\nof the Communist Party of Azerbaijan SSR] had arrived. Everyone ran to see \\nBagirov, what news he had brought with him and how this was all being viewed \\nfrom outside. He arrived and everyone went up to him to talk to him and ask \\nhim things. Everyone was in a tremendous rage. But he was protected by \\nsoldiers, and he went up to the second floor and didn\\'t deign to speak with \\nthe people. Apparently he had more important things to do.\\n\\nSeveral hours passed. Gukasian called me and says, \"Lyudochka, find another \\ntwo or three. We\\'re going to make up lists, they asked for them upstairs, \\nlists of the dead, those whose whereabouts are unknown, and lists of people \\nwho had pogroms of their apartments and of those whose cars were burned.\" I \\nhad about 50 people in my list when they called me and said, \"Lyuda, your \\nMamma has arrived, she\\'s looking for you, she doesn\\'t believe that you are \\nalive and well and that you\\'re here.\" I gave the lists to someone and asked \\nthem to continue what I was doing and went off.\\n\\nThe list was imprecise, of course. It included Grant Adamian, Raya Tovmasian\\'s\\nfather, who was alive, but at the time they thought him dead. There was Engels\\nGrigorian\\'s father and aunt, Cherkez and Maria. The list also included the \\nname of my girlfriend and neighbor, Zhanna Agabekian. One of the guys said \\nthat he had been told that they chopped her head off in the courtyard in front\\nof the Kosmos movie theater. We put her on the list too, and cried, but later \\nit turned out that that was just a rumor, that in fact an hour earlier she had\\nsomehow left Sumgait for the marina and from there had set sail for \\nKrasnovodsk, where, thank God, she was alive and well. I should also say that \\nin addition to those who died that list contained people who were rumored \\nmissing or who were so badly wounded that they were given up for dead.                                                                 3\\n\\nAll the lists were taken to Bagirov. I don\\'t remember how many dead were \\ncontained in the list, but it\\'s a fact that when Gukasian came in a couple \\nof minutes later he was cursing and was terribly irate. I asked, \"What\\'s \\ngoing on?\" He said, \"Lyuda, can you imagine what animals, what scoundrels\\nthey are! They say that they lost the list of the dead. Piotr Demichev\\n[Member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party\\nof the USSR] has just arrived, and we were supposed to submit the list to\\nhim, so that he\\'d see the scope of the slaughter, of the tragedy, whether it\\nwas one or fifty.\" They told him that the list had disappeared and they\\nshould ask everyone who hadn\\'t left for the Khimik boarding house all over\\nagain. There were 26 people on our second list. I think that the number 26\\nwas the one that got into the press and onto television and the radio, because\\nthat\\'s the list that Demichev got. I remember exactly that there were 26 \\npeople on the list, I had even told Aleksandr Mikhailovich that that was only \\na half of those that were on the first list. He said, \"Lyuda, please, try to\\nremember at least one more.\" But I couldn\\'t remember anyone else. But there\\nwere more than 30 dead. Of that I am certain. The government and the Procuracy\\ndon\\'t count the people who died of fright, like sick people and old people \\nwhose lives are threatened by any shock. They weren\\'t registered as victims of\\nthe Sumgait tragedy. And then there may be people we didn\\'t know. So many \\npeople left Sumgait between March 1 and 8! Most of them left for smaller towns\\nin Russia, and especially to the Northern Caucasus, to Stavropol, and the \\nKrasnodarsk Territory. We don\\'t have any information on them. I know that \\nthere are people who set out for parts around Moscow. In the periodical \\nKrestyanka [Woman Farmer] there was a call for people who know how to milk \\ncows, and for mechanics, and drivers, and I know a whole group of people went \\nto help out. Also clearly not on our list are those people who died entering\\nthe city, who were burned in their cars. No one knows about them, except the \\nAzerbaijanis, who are hardly likely to say anything about it. And there\\'s\\nmore. A great many of the people who were raped were not included in the list \\ndrawn up at the Procuracy. I know of three instances for sure, and I of course\\ndon\\'t know them all. I\\'m thinking of three women whose parents chose not to \\npublicize what had happened, that is, they didn\\'t take the matter to court, \\nthey simply left. But in so doing they didn\\'t cease being victims. One of them\\nis the first cousin of my classmate Kocharian. She lived in Microdistrict No. \\n8, on the fifth floor. I can\\'t tell you the building number and I don\\'t know \\nher name. Then comes the neighbor of one of my relatives, she lived in \\nMicrodistrict 1 near the gift shop. I don\\'t know her name, she lives on the \\nsame landing as the Sumgait procurator. They beat her father, he was holding \\nthe door while his daughter hid, but he couldn\\'t hold the door forever, and \\nwhen she climbed over the balcony to the neighbors\\' they seized her by her \\nbraid. Like the Azerbaijanis were saying, it was a very cultured mob, because \\nthey didn\\'t kill anyone, they only raped them and left. And the third one \\n. . . I don\\'t remember who the third one was anymore.\\n\\nThey transferred us on March 1. Karina still wasn\\'t herself. Yes, we lived for\\ndays in the SK, in the cultural facility, and at the Khimik. They lived there \\nand I lived at the City Party Committee because I couldn\\'t stay with Karina; \\nit was too difficult for me, but I was at peace: she had survived. I could \\nalready walk, but really it was honest words that held me up. Thanks to the \\nsocial work I did there, I managed to persevere. Aleksandr Mikhailovich said, \\n\"If it weren\\'t for the work I would go insane.\" He and I put ourselves in gear\\nand took everything upon ourselves: someone had an infant and needed diapers \\nand free food, and we went to get them. The first days we bought everything, \\nalthough we should have received it for free. They were supposed to have been \\ndispensed free of charge, and they sold it to us. Then, when we found out it \\nwas free, we went to Krayev. At the time, fortunately, you could still drop by\\nto see him like a neighbor, all the more so since everything was still clearly\\nvisible on our faces. Krayev sent a captain down and he resolved the issue.\\n\\nOn March 2 they sent two investigators to see us: Andrei Shirokov and Vladimir\\nFedorovich Bibishev. The way it worked out, in our family they had considered \\nonly Karina and me victims, maybe because she and I wound up in the hospital.\\nMother and Father are considered witnesses, but not victims.\\n\\nShirokov was involved with Karina\\'s case, and Bibishev, with mine. After I \\ntold him everything, he and I planned to sit down with the identikit and\\nrecord everyone I could remember while everything was still fresh in my mind. \\nWe didn\\'t work with the identikit until the very last day because the\\nconditions weren\\'t there. The investigative group worked slowly and did poor \\nquality work solely because the situation wasn\\'t conducive to working: there \\nweren\\'t enough automobiles, especially during the time when there was a \\ncurfew, and there were no typewriters for typing transcripts, and no still or \\nvideo cameras. I think that this was done on purpose. We\\'re not so poor that \\nwe can\\'t supply our investigators with all that stuff. It was done especially \\nto draw out the investigation, all the more so since the local authorities saw\\nthat the Armenians were leaving at the speed of light, never to return to \\nSumgait. And the Armenians had a lot to say I came to an agreement with \\nBibishev, I told him myself, \"Don\\'t you worry, if it takes us a month or two \\nmonths, I\\'ll be here. I\\'m not afraid, I looked death in the eyes five times in\\nthose two days, I\\'ll help you conduct the investigation.\"\\n\\nHe and I worked together a great deal, and I used this to shelter Karina, I\\ngave them so much to do that for a while they didn\\'t have the time to get to\\nher, so that she would at least have a week or two to get back to being her-\\nself. She was having difficulty breathing so we looked for a doctor to take x-\\nrays. She couldn\\'t eat or drink for nine days, she was nauseous. I didn\\'t eat\\nand drank virtually nothing for five days. Then, on the fifth day, when we\\nwere in Baku already, the investigator told me, \"How long can you go on like \\nthis? Well fine, so you don\\'t want to eat, you don\\'t love yourself, you\\'re\\nnot taking care of yourself, but you gave your word that you would see this\\ninvestigation through. We need you.\" Then I started eating, because in fact I\\nwas exhausted. It wasn\\'t enough that I kept seeing those faces in our apart-\\nment in my mind, every day I went to the investigative solitary confinement\\ncells and prisons. I don\\'t know . . . we were just everywhere! Probably in\\nevery prison in the city of Baku and in all the solitary confinement cells of\\nSumgait. At that time they had even turned the drunk tank into solitary \\nconfinement.\\n\\nThus far I have identified 31 of the people who were in our apartment. Mamma \\nidentified three, and Karina, two. The total is 36. Marina didn\\'t identify \\nanyone, she remembers the faces of two or three, But they weren\\'t among the \\nphotographs of those detained. I told of the neighbor I recognized. The one \\nwho went after the axe. He still hasn\\'t been detained, he\\'s still on the \\nloose. He\\'s gone, and it\\'s not clear if he will be found or not. I don\\'t know \\nhis first or last name. I know which building he lived in and I know his \\nsisters\\' faces. But he\\'s not in the city. The investigators informed me that \\neven if the investigation is closed and even if the trial is over they will \\ncontinue looking for him.\\n\\nThe 31 people I identified are largely blue-collar workers from various \\nplants, without education, and of the very lowest level in every respect.\\nMostly their ages range from 20 to 30 years; there was one who was 48. Only\\none of them was a student. He was attending the Azerbaijan Petroleum and\\nChemical Institute in Sumgait, his mother kept trying to bribe the investiga-\\ntor. Once, thinking that I was an employee and not a victim, she said in front\\nof me \"I\\'ll set you up a restaurant worth 500 rubles and give you 600 in cash\\nsimply for keeping him out of Armenia,\" that is, to keep him from landing in\\na prison on Armenian soil. They\\'re all terribly afraid of that, because if the\\ninvestigator is talking with a criminal and the criminal doesn\\'t confess even\\nthough we identified him, they tell him--in order to apply psychological\\npressure--they say, \"Fine, don\\'t confess, just keep silent. When you\\'re in an\\nArmenian prison, when they find out who you are, they\\'ll take care of you\\nin short order.\" That somehow gets to them. Many give in and start to talk.\\n\\nThe investigators and I were in our apartment and videotaped the entire\\npogrom of our apartment, as an investigative experiment. It was only then\\nthat I saw the way they had left our apartment. Even without knowing who was \\nin our apartment, you could guess. They stole, for example, all the money and \\nall the valuables, but didn\\'t take a single book. They tore them up, burned \\nthem, poured water on them, and hacked them with axes. Only the Materials\\nfrom the 27th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and James \\nFenimore Cooper\\'s Last of the Mohigans. Oh yes, lunch was ready, we were \\nboiling a chicken, and there were lemons for tea on the table. After they had \\nbeen in our apartment, both the chicken and the lemons were gone. That\\'s \\nenough to tell you what kind of people were in our apartment, people who don\\'t\\neven know anything about books. They didn\\'t take a single book, but they did \\ntake worn clothing, food, and even the cheapest of the cheap, worn-out \\nslippers.\\n\\nOf those whom I identified, four were Kafan Azerbaijanis living in Sumgait. \\nBasically, the group that went seeking \"revenge\"--let\\'s use their word for \\nit--was joined by people seeking easy gain and thrill-seekers. I talked with \\none of them. He had gray eyes, and somehow against the back-drop of all that \\nblack I remembered him specifically because of his of his eyes. Besides taking\\npart in the pogrom of our apartment, he was also involved in the murder of \\nTamara Mekhtiyeva from Building 16. She was an older Armenian who had recently\\narrived from Georgia, she lived alone and did not have anyone in Sumgait. I \\ndon\\'t know why she had a last name like that, maybe she was married to an \\nAzerbaijani. I had laid eyes on this woman only once or twice, and know \\nnothing about her. I do know that they murdered her in her apartment with an \\naxe. Murdering her wasn\\'t enough for them. They hacked her into pieces and \\nthrew them into the tub with water.\\n\\nI remember another guy really well too, he was also rather fair-skinned. You \\nknow, all the people who were in our apartment were darker than dark, both \\ntheir hair and their skin. And in contrast with them, in addition to the grey-\\neyed one, I remember this one fellow, the one l took to be a Lezgin. I \\nidentified him. As it turned out he was Eduard Robertovich Grigorian, born\\nin the city of Sumgait, and he had been convicted twice. One of our own. How \\ndid I remember him? The name Rita was tattooed on his left or right hand. I \\nkept thinking, is that Rita or \"puma,\" which it would be if you read the word \\nas Latin characters instead of Cyrillic, because the Cyrillic \"T\" was the one \\nthat looks like a Latin \"M.\" When they led him in he sat with his hands behind\\nhis back. This was at the confrontation. He swore on every holy book, tried to\\nput in an Armenian word here and there to try and spark my compassion, and \\ntold me that I was making a mistake, and called me \"dear sister.\" He said, \\n\"You\\'re wrong, how could I, an Armenian, raise my hand against my own, an \\nArmenian,\" and so on. He spoke so convincingly that even the investigator \\nasked me, \"Lyuda, are you sure it was he?\" I told him, \"I\\'ll tell you one more\\nidentifying mark. If I\\'m wrong I shall apologize and say I was mistaken. The \\nname Rita is tattooed on his left or right hand.\" He went rigid and became \\npale. They told him, \"Put your hands on the table.\" He put his hands on the\\ntable with the palms up. I said, \"Now turn your hands over,\" but he didn\\'t \\nturn his hands over. Now this infuriated me. If he had from the very start\\nacknowledged his guilt and said that he hadn\\'t wanted to do it, that they \\nforced him or something else, I would have treated him somewhat differently.\\nBut he insolently stuck to his story, \"No, I did not do anything, it wasn\\'t \\nme.\" When they turned his hands over the name Rita was in fact tattooed on his\\nhand. His face distorted and he whispered something wicked. I immediately flew\\ninto a rage. There was an ashtray on the table, a really heavy one, made out \\nof granite or something, very large, and it had ashes and butts in it. \\nCatching myself quite by surprise, I hurled that ashtray at him. But he ducked\\nand the ashtray hit the wall, and ashes and butts rained down on his head and \\nback. And he smiled. When he smiled it provoked me further. I don\\'t know how, \\nbut I jumped over the table between us and started either pounding him or \\nstrangling him; I no longer remember which. When I jumped I caught the \\nmicrophone cord. The investigator was there, Tolya . . .I no longer recall his\\nlast name, and he says, \"Lyudochka, it\\'s a Japanese microphone! Please . . .\\n\" And shut off all the equipment on the spot, it was all being video taped. \\nThey took him away. I stayed, and they talked to me a little to calm me down, \\nbecause we needed to go on working, I only remember Tolya telling me, \"You\\'re \\nsome actress! What a performance!\" I said, \"Tolya, honestly . . . \" Beforehand\\nthey would always tell me, \"Lyuda, more emotion. You speak as calmly as if \\nnothing had happened to you.\" I say, \"I don\\'t have any more strength or \\nemotion. All my emotions are behind me now, I no longer have the strength \\n. . . I don\\'t have the strength to do anything.\" And he says, \"Lyuda, how were\\nyou able to do that?\" And when I returned to normal, drinking tea and watching\\nthe tape, I said, \"Can I really have jumped over that table? I never jumped \\nthat high in gym class.\"\\n\\nSo you could say the gang that took over our apartment was international. Of \\nthe 36 we identified there was an Armenian, a Russian, Vadim Vorobyev, who \\nbeat Mamma, and 34 Azerbaijanis.\\n\\nAt the second meeting with Grigorian, when he had completely confessed his \\nguilt, he told of how on February 27 the Azerbaijanis had come knocking. Among\\nthem were guys--if you can call them guys--he knew from prison. They said, \\n\"Tomorrow we\\'re going after the Armenians. Meet us at the bus station at three\\no\\'clock.\" He said, \"No, I\\'m not coming.\" They told him, \"If you don\\'t come \\nwe\\'ll kill you.\" He said, \"Alright, I\\'ll come.\" And he went.\\n\\nThey also went to visit my classmate from our microdistrict, Kamo Pogosian. He\\nhad also been in prison; I think that together they had either stolen a \\nmotorcycle or dismantled one to get some parts they needed. They called him \\nout of his apartment and told him the same thing: \"Tomorrow we\\'re going to get\\nthe Armenians. Be there.\" He said, \"No.\" They pulled a knife on him. He said, \\n\"I\\'m not going all the same.\" And in the courtyard on the 27th they stabbed \\nhim several times, in the stomach. He was taken to the hospital. I know he was\\nin the hospital in Baku, in the Republic hospital. If we had known about that \\nwe would have had some idea of what was to come on the 28th.\\n\\nI\\'ll return to Grigorian, what he did in our apartment. I remember that he\\nbeat me along with all the rest. He spoke Azerbaijani extremely well. But he\\nwas very fair-skinned, maybe that led me to think that they had it out for\\nhim, too. But later it was proved that he took part in the beating and burning\\nof Shagen Sargisian. I don\\'t know if he participated in the rapes in our \\napartment; I didn\\'t see, I don\\'t remember. But the people who were in our \\napartment who didn\\'t yet know that he was an Armenian said that he did. I \\ndon\\'t know if he confessed or not, and I myself don\\'t recall because I blacked\\nout very often. But I think that he didn\\'t participate in the rape of Karina\\nbecause he was in the apartment the whole time. When they carried her into the\\ncourtyard, he remained in the apartment.\\n\\nAt one point I was talking with an acquaintance about Edik Grigorian. From her\\nI learned that his wife was a dressmaker, his mother is Russian, he doesn\\'t \\nhave a father, and that he\\'s been convicted twice. Well this will be his third\\nand, I hope, last sentence. He beat his wife, she was eternally coming to work\\nwith bruises. His wife was an Armenian by the name of Rita.\\n\\nThe others who were detained . . . well they\\'re little beasts. You really can\\'t\\ncall them beasts, they\\'re just little beasts. They were robots carrying out\\nsomeone else\\'s will, because at the investigation they all said, \"I don\\'t \\nunderstand how I could have done that, I was out of my head.\" But we know that\\nthey were won around to it and prepared for it, that\\'s why they did it. In the\\nname of Allah, in the name of the Koran, in the name of propagating Islam--\\nthat\\'s holy to them--that\\'s why they did everything they were commanded to do.\\nBecause I saw they didn\\'t have minds of their own, I\\'m not talking about their\\nlevel of cultural sophistication or any higher values. No education, they\\nwork, have a slew of children without the means to raise them properly, they \\ncrowd them in, like at the temporary housing, and apparently, they were \\npromised that if they slaughtered the Armenians they would receive apartments.\\nSo off they went. Many of them explained their participation saying, \"they \\npromised us apartments.\"\\n\\nAmong them was one who genuinely repented. I am sure that he repented from the\\nheart and that he just despised himself after the incident. He worked at a \\nchildren\\'s home, an Azerbaijani, he has two children, and his wife works at \\nthe children\\'s home too. Everything that they acquired, everything that they \\nhave they earned by their own labor, and wasn\\'t inherited from parents or \\ngrandparents. And he said, \"I didn\\'t need anything I just don\\'t know . . . how\\nI ended up in that; it was like some hand was guiding me. I had no will of my \\nown, I had no strength, no masculine dignity, nothing.\" And the whole time I\\nkept repeating, \"Now you imagine that someone did the same to your young wife \\nright before your own eyes.\" He sat there and just wailed.\\n\\nBut that leader in the Eskimo dogskin coat was not detained. He performed a \\nmarvelous disappearing act, but I think that they\\'ll get onto him, they just \\nhave to work a little, because that Vadim, that boy, according to his\\ngrandfather, is in touch with the young person who taught him what to do, how \\nto cover his tracks. He was constantly exchanging jackets with other boys he \\nknew and those he didn\\'t, either, and other things as well, and changed \\nhimself like a chameleon so they wouldn\\'t get onto him, but he was detained.\\n\\nThat one in the Eskimo dogskin coat was at the Gambarians\\' after Aleksandr \\nGambarian was murdered. He came in and said, \"Let\\'s go, enough, you\\'ve spilled\\nenough blood here.\"\\n\\nMaybe Karina doesn\\'t know this but the reason they didn\\'t finish her off was \\nthat they were hoping to take her home with them. I heard this from Aunt Tanya\\nand her sons, the Kasumovs, who were in the courtyard near the entryway. They \\nliked her very much, and they had decided to take her to home with them. When \\nKarina came to at one point--she doesn\\'t remember this yet, this the neighbors \\nold me--and she saw that there was no one around her, she started crawling to \\nthe entryway. They saw that she was still alive and came back, they were \\nalready at the third entryway, on their way to the Gambarians\\'. They came back\\nand started beating her to finish her. If she had not come to she would have \\nsustained lesser bodily injuries, they would have beat her less. An older \\nwoman from our building, Aunt Nazan, an Azerbaijani, all but lay on top of \\nKarina, crying and pleading that they leave her alone, but they flung her off.\\nThe woman\\'s grown sons were right nearby; they picked her up in their hands \\nand led her home. She howled and cried out loudly and swore: God is on Earth, \\nhe sees everything, and He won\\'t forgive this.\\n\\nThere was another woman, too, Aunt Fatima, a sick, aging woman from the first \\nfloor, she\\'s already retired. Mountain dwellers, and Azerbaijanis, too, have a\\ncustom: If men are fighting, they throw a scarf under their feet to stop them.\\nBut they trampled her scarf and sent her home. To trample a scarf is \\ntantamount to trampling a woman\\'s honor.\\n\\nNow that the investigation is going on, now that a lot is behind us and we \\nhave gotten back to being ourselves a little, I think about how could these \\nevents that are now called the Sumgait tragedy happen? How did they come \\nabout? How did it start? Could it have been avoided? Well, it\\'s clear that \\nwithout a signal, without permission from the top leadership, it would not \\nhave happened. All the same, I\\'m not afraid to say this, the Azerbaijanis,\\nlet other worthy people take no offense, the better representatives of their \\nnations, let them take no offense, but the Azerbaijanis in their majority are \\na people who are kept in line only by fear of the law, fear of retribution for\\nwhat they have done. And when the law said that they could do all that, like\\nunleashed dogs who were afraid they wouldn\\'t have time to do everything, they \\nthrew themselves from one thing to the next so as to be able to get more done,\\nto snatch a bit more. The smell of the danger was already in the air on\\nFebruary 27. You could tell that something was going to happen. And everyone \\nwho had figured it out took steps to avoid running into those gangs. Many left\\nfor their dachas, got plane tickets for the other end of the country, just got\\nas far away as their legs would carry them.\\n\\nFebruary 27 was a Saturday. I was teaching my third class. The director came \\ninto my classroom and said that I should let the children out, that there had \\nbeen a call from the City Party Committee asking that all teachers gather for \\na meeting at Lenin Square. Well, I excused the children, and there were few \\nteachers left at school, altogether three women, the director, and six or \\nseven men. The rest had already gone home. We got to Lenin Square and there \\nwere a great many people there. This was around five-thirty or six in the \\nevening, no later. They were saying all kinds of rubbish up on the podium and \\nthe crowd below was supporting them stormily, roaring. They spoke over the \\nmicrophone about what had happened in Kafan a few days earlier and that the \\ndriver of a bus going to some district had recently thrown a small Azerbaijani\\nchild off the bus. The speaker affirmed that he was an eyewitness, that he had\\nseen it himself..The crowd started to rage: \"Death to the Armenians! They must\\nbe killed!\" Then a woman went up on stage. I didn\\'t see the woman because \\npeople were clinging to the podium like flies. I could only hear her. The \\nwoman introduced herself as coming from Kafan, and said that the Armenians \\ncut her daughters\\' breasts off, and called, \"Sons, avenge my daughters!\" That \\nwas enough. A portion of the people on the square took off running in the \\ndirection of the factories, toward the beginning of Lenin Street.\\n\\nWe stood there about an hour. Then the director of School 25 spoke, he gave a \\nvery nationalist speech. He said, \"Brother Muslims, kill the Armenians!\" This \\nhe repeated every other sentence. When he said this the crowd supported him \\nstormily, whistling and shouting \"Karabagh!\" He said, \"Karabagh has been our \\nterritory my whole life long, Karabagh is my soul. How can you tear out my \\nheart?\" As though an Azerbaijani would die without Karabagh. \"It\\'s our \\nterritory, the Armenians will never see it. The Armenians must be eliminated. \\nFrom time immemorial Muslims have cleansed the land of infidel Armenians, from\\ntime immemorial, that\\'s the way nature created it, that every 20 to 30 years \\nthe Azerbaijanis should cleanse the land of filth.\" By filth he meant \\nArmenians.\\n\\nI heard this. Before that I hadn\\'t been listening to the speeches closely.\\nMany people spoke and I stood with my back to the podium, talking shop with \\nthe other teachers, and somehow it all went right by, it didn\\'t penetrate,\\nthat in fact something serious was taking place. Then, when one of our\\nteachers said, \"Listen to what he\\'s saying, listen to what idiocy he\\'s \\nspouting,\" we listened. That was the speech of that director. Before that we \\nlistened to the woman\\'s speech.\\n\\nRight then in our group--there were nine of us--the mood changed, and the \\nsubject of conversation and all school matters were forgotten. Our director of\\nstudies, for whom I had great respect, he\\'s an Azerbaijani . . . Before that I\\nhad considered him an upstanding and worthy person, if there was a need to \\nobtain leave we had asked him, he seemed like a good person. So he tells me,\\n\"Lyuda, you know that besides you there are no Armenians on the square? If \\nthey find out that you\\'re an Armenian they\\'ll tear you to pieces. Should I \\ntell them you\\'re an Armenian? Should I tell them you\\'re an Armenian?\" When he \\nsaid it the first time I pretended not to hear it, and then he asked me a \\nsecond time. I turned to the director, Khudurova, and said that it was already\\nafter eight, I was expected at home, and I should be leaving. She answered, \\n\"No, they said that women should stay here until ten o\\'clock,.and men, until \\ntwelve. Stay here.\" There was a young teacher with us, her children were in \\nkindergarten and her husband worked shifts. She asked to leave: \"I left my \\nchildren at the kindergarten.\" The director excused her. When she let her go I\\nturned around, said, \"Good-bye,\" and left with the young teacher, the \\nAzerbaijani. I didn\\'t see them after that.\\n\\nWhen we were walking the buses weren\\'t running, and a crowd from the rally ran\\nnearby us. They had apparently gotten all fired up. It must have become too \\nmuch for them, and they wanted to seek vengeance immediately, so they rushed \\noff. I wasn\\'t afraid this time because I was sure that the other teacher \\nwouldn\\'t say that I was an Armenian.\\n\\nTo make it short, we reached home. Then Karina told of how they had been at \\nthe movies and what had happened there. I started telling of my experience and\\nagain my parents didn\\'t understand that we were in danger. We watched \\ntelevision as usual, and didn\\'t even imagine that tomorrow would be our last \\nday. That\\'s how it all was.\\n\\nAt the City Party Committee I met an acquaintance, we went to school together,\\nZhanna, I don\\'t remember her last name, she lives above the housewares store \\non Narimanov Street. She was there with her father, for some reason she \\ndoesn\\'t have a mother. The two of them were at home alone. While her father \\nheld the door she jumped from the third floor, and she was lucky that the \\nground was wet and that there wasn\\'t anyone behind the building when she went \\nout on the balcony, there was no one there, they were all standing near the \\nentryway. That building was also a lucky one in that there were no murders \\nthere. She jumped. She jumped and didn\\'t feel any pain in the heat of the \\nmoment. A few days later I found out that she couldn\\'t stand up, she had been \\ninjured somehow. That\\'s how people in Sumgait saved their lives, their honor, \\nand their children: any way they could. \\n\\nWhere it was possible, the Armenians fought back. My father\\'s first cousin, \\nArmen M., lives in Block 30. They found out by phone from one of the victims \\nwhat was going on in town. The Armenians in that building all called one \\nanother immediately and all of them armed themselves with axes, knives, even \\nwith muskets and went up to the roof. They took their infants with them, and \\ntheir old women who had been in bed for God knows how many months, they got \\nthem right out of their beds and took everyone upstairs. They hooked \\nelectricity up to the trap door to the roof and waited, ready to fight. Then \\nthey took the daughter of the school board director hostage, she\\'s an \\nAzerbaijani who lived in their building. They called the school board director\\nand told her that if she didn\\'t help them, the 17 Armenians on the roof, to \\nescape alive and unharmed, she\\'d never see her daughter again. I\\'m sure, of \\ncourse, that Armenians would never lay a hand on a woman, it was just the only\\nthing that could have saved them at the time. She called the police. The \\nArmenians made a deal with the local police to go into town. Two armored \\npersonnel carriers and soldiers were summoned They surrounded the entryway and\\nled everyone down from the roof, and off to the side from the armored \\npersonnel carriers was a crowd that was on its way to the building at that \\nvery moment, into Block 30. That\\'s how they defended themselves.\\n\\nI heard that our neighbors, Roman and Sasha Gambarian, resisted. They\\'re big, \\nstrong guys. Their father was killed. And I heard that the brothers put up a \\nstrong defense and lost their father, but were able to save their mother.\\n\\nOne of the neighbors told me that after it happened, when they were looking \\nfor the criminals on March 1 to 2 and detaining everyone they suspected, \\npeople hid people in our entryway, maybe people who were injured or perhaps \\ndead. The neighbors themselves were afraid to go there, and when they went \\nwith the soldiers into our basement they are supposed to have found \\nAzerbaijani corpses. I don\\'t know how many. Even if they had been wounded and \\nput down there, after two days they would have died from loss of blood or \\ninfection--that basement was filled with water. I heard this from the \\nneighbors. And later when I was talking with the investigators the subject \\ncame up and they confirmed it. I know, too, that for several hours the \\nbasement was used to store objects stolen from our apartment. And our neighbor\\ncarried out our carpet, along with the rest: he stole it for himself, posing \\nas one of the criminals. Everyone was taking his own share, and the neighbor \\ntook his, too, and carried it home. And when we came back, when everything \\nseemed to have calmed down, he returned it, saying that it was the only thing \\nof ours he had managed to \"save.\"\\n\\nRaya\\'s husband and father defended themselves. The Trdatovs defended \\nthemselves, and so did other Armenian families. To be sure there were\\nAzerbaijani victims, although we\\'ll never hear anything about them. For some \\nreason our government doesn\\'t want to say that the Armenians were not just \\nvictims, but that they defended the honor of their sisters and mothers, too. \\nIn the TV show \"Pozitsiya\" [Viewpoint] a military man, an officer, said that \\nthe Armenians did virtually nothing to defend themselves. But that\\'s not \\nimportant, the truth will come out regardless.\\n\\nSo that\\'s the price we paid those three days. For three days our courage, our \\nbravery, and our humanity was tested. It was those three days, and not the \\nyears and dozens of years we had lived before them, that showed what we\\'ve \\nbecome, what we grew up to be. Those three days showed who was who.\\n\\nOn that I will conclude my narrative on the Sumgait tragedy. It should be said\\nthat it\\'s not over yet, the trials are still ahead of us, and the punishments\\nreceived by those who so violated us, who wanted to make us into nonhumans \\nwill depend on our position and on the work of the investigators, the \\nProcuracy, and literally of every person who lent his hand to the investiga-\\ntion. That\\'s the price we paid to live in Armenia, to not fear going out on \\nthe street at night, to not be afraid to say we\\'re Armenians, and to not fear\\nspeaking our native tongue.\\n\\n   October 15,1988\\n   Yerevan\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t- - - reference for #008 - - -\\n\\n[1] _The Sumgait Tragedy; Pogroms against Armenians in Soviet Azerbaijan,\\n    Volume I, Eyewitness Accounts_, edited by Samuel Shahmuradian, forward by\\n    Yelena Bonner, 1990, published by Aristide D.

Oh yes, it also needs to be\\ncheap.  \\n\\nMy first circuit was a dismal failure.  I used 3 compariators; each\\ncompariator had the + input going to one of the guns, the - input\\nwent to a reference created by a voltage divider(a potentiometer).\\n\\nThe first problem was that the compariator was way too slow.. I\\nneeded to get several pixels in a row before it would fire the\\ncompariators, so I could have a whole screen full of text, but my\\ncircuit would not detect it.   \\n\\nThe second problem is that there was more noise on the reference then\\nthe smallest difference between a blank screen and a dim screen.  In\\nfact the difference between completely black and completely white is\\nonly 650 mv.

It has\\n\\tcertainly shown itself to be persistent as a belief system, in\\n\\tspite of various persecutions throughout the past two millenia.\\n\\tThat it continues to persevere does not demonstrate that it is\\n\\t\"infectious\" in a derrogatory sense; it may be that it provides\\n\\ta workable system for its adherents (and I would argue that this\\n\\tis the case).\\n\\n\\tI disagree that Christianity is \"a safety blanket\" which supplants\\n\\thope and purpose.  Rather, it points an individual to the one\\n\\tSource of hope and purpose.  There is nothing hidden about a\\n\\tChristian\\'s source for hope and purpose.  Of what usefulness to\\n\\tyou is the distinction between internally motivated hope and purpose\\n\\tand externally given hope and purpose?  Is the (apparent) loss of\\n\\tcontrol over one\\'s own life the problem or is it something else?\\n\\n\\tFinally, one does not appropriate \"eternal happiness\" by following\\n\\tChristian moral standards.  Indeed, the sole reason for the existance\\n\\tof Christianity is *because* standards are inadequate to save people\\n\\tfrom their imperfections.  Moral standards are merely guides to the\\n\\tChristian; the real power to moral living is given to the Christian\\n\\tin the Person of God\\'s Spirit.\\n\\n\\tHeaven is one of two final states that\\n\\tChristian doctrine postulates.  However, Christians are generally\\n\\tnot motivated to live according to Christian moral standards by this\\n\\tpromised future reward; rather, they are motivated by the perceived\\n\\tbenefits to them in the here-and-now.\\n\\n\\n\\tMany Christian organizations are concerned with evangelism as a\\n\\tpriority, and rightly so (for it was Jesus Himself who gave this\\n\\tas a priority for His followers).  However, it is not the penultimate\\n\\tpriority as evangelism is normally understood (i.e. preach the word,\\n\\tconvert at nearly any cost, repeat with new convert ad infinitum).\\n\\tRather, such evangelism is generally best done through respecting\\n\\tthe opinions of others while *demonstrating* the very real benefits\\n\\tof a Christian lifestyle.  This demonstration should be so powerful\\n\\tthat it compels the non-Christian to seek out the Christian to ask\\n\\t\"Why?\"  Needless to say, such a demonstration is not easily accom-\\n\\tplished (it takes a radical committment to the person of Jesus), it\\n\\tdoes not happen quickly (so perseverance on the part of the Christian\\n\\tis required), and it cannot occur where no personal bonds of\\n\\tfriendship exist (it is ineffective with strangers who cannot\\n\\tevaluate the demonstration over time, and it is easy to alienate or\\n\\tharm others if the sole purpose of being a \"friend\" is to gain a\\n\\tconversion).\\n\\n\\tAs a long-time Christian (nearly 20 years), I view with some skep-\\n\\tticism *all* evangelism programs which incorporate a \"hurry-up\"\\n\\tattitude.  Pressured conversions may ultimately be worse than no\\n\\tconversion at all (because the pressured convert realizes s/he was\\n\\tcoerced and disavows Christianity when they would have been open\\n\\tto it in the future had they not been taken advantage of now).\\n\\tThe Bible states that it is the very Spirit of God which brings\\n\\tconviction of wrong-doing to people.  I am content to do my part\\n\\t(witness) and let the Spirit do the rest.\\n\\n\\n\\tWe are far more than animals.  We sleep, eat, reproduce, and die\\n\\tjust as other animals do - true.

       " 'From: Center for Policy Research <cpr>\\nSubject: Labour\\'s enclaves policy.IMPORTANT\\n\\n\\nLabour\\'s enclaves policy in the occupied territories\\n\\nby Israel Shahak\\npubl. in Middle East International, London, 30.4.93\\n\\nIt is not difficult to discover Israel\\'s policy towards the \\nPalestinians at any given time. It can be easily inferred \\nfrom the facts on the ground and from the information \\nprovided by the Hebrew press. There is one condition, \\nthough. The torrents of claptrap about \"the peace \\nprocess\" must be totally ignored, as must Israel\\'s official \\npronouncements, whole sole purpose is to distort reality. \\nBy concentrating only on the facts, it was early apparent \\nthat Labour\\'s policies were no different from those of \\nShamir but for their greater reliance on deceit and their \\nmore effective implementation.\\n\\nLikud\\'s policies were accurately described by Ariel \\nSharon in an article, accompanied by a map, in Yediot \\nAharonot last August. The Sharon plan envisaged a \\ndivision of the West Bank into seven, and the Gaza Strip \\ninto four, \"autonomous\" Palestinian enclaves, all of them \\nunder Israeli supervision. The total area of these \\nenclaves amounted to about 15 per cent of the \\nterritories. The rest was to be controlled by the Israeli \\nsettlements and the highways built around the enclaves. \\nThe entire area around Jerusalem, from the outskirts of \\nRamallah to the boundaries of Bethlehem, has already \\nbeen turned into a \"Greater Jerusalem\" where the Arab-\\ninhabited localities amount to small enclaves surrounded \\nby areas occupied by Israeli settlements or reserved for \\nthem.\\n\\nJudging from Labour\\'s settlement policy, it may be \\nassumed that it may content itself with a lesser number \\nof Arab enclaves of a rather larger size than Sharon had \\nplanned. But the principle of surrounding the enclaves by \\nsettlements strategically dispersed along the highways \\nremains unchanged. Labour plans only four enclaves in \\nthe West Bank: two in \"Samaria\" and two in \"Judea\" (i.e. \\nnorth and south of Jerusalem respectively), and no more \\nthan two in the Gaza Strip. In regard to \"Greater \\nJerusalem\", Labour\\'s policies hardly deviate from \\nSharon\\'s.\\n\\nA saner version of Likud policy\\n\\nAs some Israeli correspondents at once realised, Labour \\npolicies were but a saner version of Sharon\\'s \\nextravaganza. Last July, Gideon Eshet wrote in Yediot \\nAharonot that, while \"barely a few months ago\" Labour \\nsupported the demand to freeze all construction beyond \\nthe Green Line, \"no specific decision to freeze \\nconstruction in the territories has been taken\". And Uzi \\nBenziman wrote in Ha\\'aretz that \"as far as can be judged \\non the basis of the internal political discussions in \\nJerusalem, Rabin intends to stick to Likud\\'s ways\".\\n\\nThe two biggest enclaves envisaged by Labour are \\nlocated in \"Samaria\". Therefore the belt of settlements \\naround the \"Trans-Samaria Highway\", designed to \\nseparate those enclaves from each other, is of paramount \\nimportance. According to the latest data, the percentage \\nof Israeli settlers in the entire West Bank population \\n(apart from East Jerusalem) is a mere 5.5 per cent. But \\nfor the area around the \"Trans-Samaria Highway\", the \\ncorresponding figure is almost 20 per cent, and it is \\nincreasing steadily. The situation in the settlements of \\nthe \"Efrat Block\" south of Jerusalem, designed to sever \\nthe enclave around Bethlehem from the one around \\nHebron, is pretty much the same. The \"Efrat Block\" is now \\nbeing connected with West Jerusalem by a highway.\\n\\nThe project is costly in the extreme, because the highway \\nis designed to bypass Bethlehem by a sequence of long \\ntunnels. The final decision to build this highway was \\nsuspended until Rabin\\'s return from his US visit in \\nMarch. The subsequent decision to renew its construction \\ncan be seen as US approval for the enclaves plan as a \\nwhole.\\n\\nProcess of impoverishment\\n\\nThe enclaves plan implies deliberate and steady \\nimpoverishment of the Palestinians. This is well known \\nin Israel but ignored abroad by all who should be \\nconcerned, including the PLO. In regard to the Gaza Strip, \\nthe whole process was best described by Ze\\'ev Shiff in \\nHa\\'aretz in March. He mentions having seen \"a pamphlet \\nissued six years ago by the Civil Administration \\nforecasting the conditions in the Gaza Strip under Israeli \\nrule in 2000\". His analysis deserves to be quoted \\nextensively:\\n\\n\"We continue to steal the Strip\\'s water, even though its \\nquality deteriorates from year to year. We continue to \\nsteal the Strip\\'s tiny land resources, in order to found \\nthere more and more settlements, as if we deliberately \\nwant to make the inhabitants despair, and in their \\ndespair think in termws of having nothing to lose. It is \\nby our own doing that the Strip\\'s workers must now \\nspend travelling to their workplaces almost as much time \\nas they spend working. From the military point of view, \\nwe have kept control of no more than half the Strip\\'s \\narea at an increasingly exorbitant price in manpower and \\nresources. About a year before Moshe Arens left the \\ndefence ministry, I heard him saying that we should \\nwithdraw from the Strip come what may. His argument \\nwas that Israel sinks into the Strip ever deeper and \\ndeeper. He told me he had proposed this to Yitzhak \\nShamir but he rejected it.\" Yitzhak Rabin rejects it too.\\n\\nEnormous state support for the Qatif Block settlers can \\nalso be cited as proof that the enclaves plan is being \\nimplemented. The Qatif Block settlements, founded by \\nthe first Rabin government of 1974-77, are intended to \\ndivide the Gaza Strip into two separate enclaves. Efraim \\nDavidi of Davar had data showing how vital for Israeli \\nthis enterprise is. \"The Qatif Block is now producing 40 \\nper cent of Israeli tomatoes destined for export, and a \\nsubstantial proportion of cut flowers.\" He also deals with \\nthe subsidies the settlers receive, considerably \\naugmented by the present government. Owing to them, \\nhousing units are cheap. The present government does \\nnot spare efforts to recruit new settlers to the block. \\n\"Any prospective settler will get a 95 per cent mortgage \\nfor his house on top of a grant of 18,000 shekels \\n($6,500).\"\\n\\nSuch data shows that Israel\\'s plans apply whether the \\nPalestinians of the Gaza Strip are allowed or forbidden to \\nwork in Israel. The economic motivations were explained \\nby Danny Rubinstein in Ha\\'aretz in March:\\n\\n\"From the economic viewpoint Gaza could already be \\nsealed off hermetically and all the Strip\\'s workers could \\nbe barred from entering Israel...Even though accurate \\ndata is hard to come by, it is indisputable that during the \\nlast two years the numbes of Gazan workers arriving \\ndaily to work in Israel has markedly decreased, from \\n80,000 in the mid\\'80s to 40,000 today. But the decrease \\nis not only due to restrictions imposed on entering Israel \\nfrom Gaza. It is also due to the drastic curtailment of \\ndemand for Gazan labour in Israel. With unemployment \\nin Israel soaring and the construction of apartments \\nblocks virtually halted, the workers from Gaza are no \\nlonger really needed...\"\\n\\nGaza\\'s total dependence\\n\\nThe entire economy of the Gaza Strip is totally dependent \\non Israel. In recent years in the Gaza Strip there has \\nbeen an increase in sub-contracted work for Israeli \\nfactories, mostly footware and textiles. Thousands of \\nsmall workshops, employing an average of four workers, \\nget their raw materials or unfinished products, together \\nwith detailed working instructions, from Israeli factories. \\nRubinstein attributes this development to the fact that \\n\"the average wage in the Gaza Strip is merely 40 per cent \\nof that in the West Bank, which in turn stands at half the \\naverage wage in Israel; and besides the Gazan employer \\ndoes not pay any social security for his employees.\" If \\nthe average wage in the Gaza Strip is just a fifth of that \\nin Israel, the profits of Israeli factories and even of \\nPalestinian sub-contractors must be vast.\\n\\nThey are higher still when \"a Gazan sub-contractor \\nprovides labour to be performed at home, with the \\nfamily\\'s help. The livelihood of tens of thousands of \\nGazans depends on such sub-contracted work.\" Many of \\nthem are women and children, paid about ten shekels \\n($3.50) a day which can last 12 hours or more. There can \\nbe no doubt that profits from exploiting cheap Gazan \\nlabour are one of the reasons for the stubborn opposition \\nof Rabin and other Israeli ministers to withdrawal from \\nthe Strip.\\n\\nEconomic conditions in the Gaza Strip differ little from \\nwhat was created straight after Israel\\'s conquest [in \\n1967]. In this respect, one should not be deluded by the \\ntalk, nowadays fashionable, about Israeli gestures \\nintended to \"encourage economic development in the \\nterritories\", As Israeli journalists point out, all permits \\nfor opening new businesses depend on a prior approval \\nby the Shin Bet. \"Behind all the professed goodwill there \\nis no desire to solve problems, just the attitude of a good \\ncolonialist, willing to do something for the benefit of the \\nnatives, but on condition that they behave nicely, do not \\nbecome rebellious, and never do anything against the \\ninterests of the metropolis, its economic interests \\nincluded,\" wrote Michal Sela in Davar in February. The \\ndevelopment of sub-contracted work in the Gaza Strip \\naccords perfectly with Sela\\'s diagnosis.\\n\\nSela also shows how exactly the economic controls work. \\n\"In all branches of the economy, lobbies have been set in \\nmotion for purposes of freeing Israeli production from \\nthe threat of any Palestinian competition. The method is \\nsimplicity itself. As soon as any Israeli producer succeeds \\nin persuading the government, or even the trade and \\nindustry minister alone, a military order is issued \\nprohibiting the export of a given produce to Israel. If this \\ndoes not suffice, a Palestinian factory may be denied a \\nlicence to operate or bureaucratic obstacles may paralyse \\nits production.\" Among the most active of such lobbies is \\nthe agricultural one. It has succeeded in limiting exports \\nof Gazan vegetables (except for those grown by settlers) \\nnot only to Israel but also to Europe, where they \\notherwise might compete with Israeli exports.\\n\\nPerpetuaring apartheid\\n\\nLabour\\'s goal is to perpetuate this apartheid regime in \\nthe territories. The same goal is shared by the US, which \\notherwise could not support the Labour government so \\nfirmly. In my view one of the reasons the US feels \\nhappier about supporting Labour than Likud is its \\ngreater efficiency in pursuing the settlement drive. This \\npoint was brought home by Ofer Shelah in Ma\\'ariv, who \\ndeplored the settlers\\' failure which he attributed to \\nLikud\\'s inefficiency. he showed that the peak yearly \\nsettlement growth \"occured during the term of office of \\nthe National Unity government (i.e. 1984-90) in which \\nRabin served throughout as the defence minister\". \\nLikud\\'s reputation for settling the territories better than \\nLabour is false, attributable to the many tiny settlements \\nwithout strategic value founded under Shamir for \\nsymbolic reasons.\\n\\nTo sum up: Labour\\'s policy, unconditionally supported by \\nthe US differs from that of Likud primarily in the \\nefficiency with which it is implemented. According to \\nthat policy the territories are to be divided into two \\nparts. The major part is to be ruled by Israel directly, \\nand the minor part indirectly. In my view, this racist \\nscheme is doomed to ultimately fail, but at a horrifying \\nprice in human suffering. The sooner its true nature is \\nrecognised, the less suffering it may cause.',\n",

Try setting your\\nstereo TV or VCR to receive the SAP audio channel, and go station\\njumping to find out which one is broadcasting this information.\\nI believe this program is also subsidized, making the in-vehicle\\nreceivers cheap to purchase (and without having to incur monthly\\nfees to use it).  Since the makers of these in-vehicle receivers\\ndon\\'t have to pay for the broadcast (this may not be completely\\ntrue), they likely have no investment in keeping the system\\nup and running when the Cal Trans stuff hits the airwaves.  You\\nmay have a nifty little TV audio receiver in your car, nothing\\nmore, when this happens.  Perhaps a word to the wise...?  ;)\\n\\nI think we\\'d all be interested in a summary post if you get more\\ninfo on how the LA system is networked and paid for.',\n",

Agdam, Azerbaijan, Thursday\\n\\n        The exact number of victims is still unclear,  but there can be \\n        little  doubt that Azeri civilians were massacred  by  Armenian \\n        fighters in the snowy mountains of Nagorno-Karabakh last week. \\n\\n        Refugees  from the enclave town of Khojaly,  sheltering in  the \\n        Azeri border town of Agdam, give largely consistent accounts of \\n        how  their  enemies  attacked their homes on the  night  of  25 \\n        February,    chased  those  who  fled  and  shot  them  in  the \\n        surrounding forests. Yesterday, I saw 75  freshly dug graves in \\n        one  cemetery  in  addition to four mutilated corpses  we  were \\n        shown in the mosque when we arrived in Agdam late on Tuesday. I \\n        also  saw women and children with bullet wounds in a  makeshift \\n        hospital in a string of railway carriages. \\n\\n        Khojaly, an Azeri settlement in the enclave mostly populated by \\n        Armenians,  had a population of about 6000. Mr.  Rashid Mamedov \\n        Commander of Police in Agdam,  said  only about 500  escaped to \\n        his  town.   \" So where are the rest?\".  Some might have  taken \\n        prisoner, he said, or fled. Many bodies were still lying in the \\n        mountains  because  the  Azeris were short  of  helicopters  to \\n        retrieve them. He believed more than 1000 had perished, some of \\n        cold in temperatures as low as minus 10 degrees. \\n\\n        One  refugee,  Rami Nasiru,  described how Khojaly residents at \\n        first thought the attack was no more than the routine  shooting \\n        to  which they had become accustomed in four years of conflict. \\n        But  when  they  saw the Armenians with  a  convoy  of  armored \\n        personnel carriers, they realised they could not hope to defend \\n        themselves  with  machineguns and grenades,  and fled into  the \\n        forests. In the small hours, the massacre started. \\n\\n        Mr.  Nasiru,  who believes his wife and two children were taken \\n        prisoner,   repeated what many other refugees have said -  that \\n        troops of the former Soviet army helped the Armenians to attack \\n        Khojaly. \"It is not my opinion, I saw it with my own eyes.\" \\n\\n\\nSerdar Argic',\n",

JPEG is designed for compressing either\\nfull-color or gray-scale digital images of \"natural\", real-world scenes.\\nIt does not work so well on non-realistic images, such as cartoons or line\\ndrawings.\\n\\nJPEG does not handle black-and-white (1-bit-per-pixel) images, nor does it\\nhandle motion picture compression.  Standards for compressing those types\\nof images are being worked on by other committees, named JBIG and MPEG\\nrespectively.\\n\\nJPEG is \"lossy\", meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn\\'t\\nquite identical to what you originally put in.  The algorithm achieves much\\nof its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye, notably\\nthe fact that small color details aren\\'t perceived as well as small details\\nof light-and-dark.  Thus, JPEG is intended for compressing images that will\\nbe looked at by humans.  If you plan to machine-analyze your images, the\\nsmall errors introduced by JPEG may be a problem for you, even if they are\\ninvisible to the eye.\\n\\nA useful property of JPEG is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by\\nadjusting compression parameters.  This means that the image maker can trade\\noff file size against output image quality.  You can make *extremely* small\\nfiles if you don\\'t mind poor quality; this is useful for indexing image\\narchives, making thumbnail views or icons, etc. etc.  Conversely, if you\\naren\\'t happy with the output quality at the default compression setting, you\\ncan jack up the quality until you are satisfied, and accept lesser compression.\\n\\n\\n[2]  Why use JPEG?\\n\\nThere are two good reasons: to make your image files smaller, and to store\\n24-bit-per-pixel color data instead of 8-bit-per-pixel data.\\n\\nMaking image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across\\nnetworks and for archiving libraries of images.  Being able to compress a\\n2 Mbyte full-color file down to 100 Kbytes or so makes a big difference in\\ndisk space and transmission time!  (If you are comparing GIF and JPEG, the\\nsize ratio is more like four to one.  More details below.)\\n\\nIf your viewing software doesn\\'t support JPEG directly, you\\'ll have to\\nconvert JPEG to some other format for viewing or manipulating images.  Even\\nwith a JPEG-capable viewer, it takes longer to decode and view a JPEG image\\nthan to view an image of a simpler format (GIF, for instance).  Thus, using\\nJPEG is essentially a time/space tradeoff: you give up some time in order to\\nstore or transmit an image more cheaply.\\n\\nIt\\'s worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved, the\\ntime savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the\\nextra time to decompress the file.  I\\'ll let you do the arithmetic yourself.\\n\\nThe other reason why JPEG will gradually replace GIF as a standard Usenet\\nposting format is that JPEG can store full color information: 24 bits/pixel\\n(16 million colors) instead of 8 or less (256 or fewer colors).  If you have\\nonly 8-bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage\\nto you.  Within a couple of years, though, 8-bit GIF will look as obsolete as\\nblack-and-white MacPaint format does today.  Furthermore, for reasons detailed\\nin section 7, JPEG is far more useful than GIF for exchanging images among\\npeople with widely varying color display hardware.  Hence JPEG is considerably\\nmore appropriate than GIF for use as a Usenet posting standard.\\n\\n\\n[3]  When should I use JPEG, and when should I stick with GIF?\\n\\nJPEG is *not* going to displace GIF entirely; for some types of images,\\nGIF is superior in image quality, file size, or both.  One of the first\\nthings to learn about JPEG is which kinds of images to apply it to.\\n\\nAs a rule of thumb, JPEG is superior to GIF for storing full-color or\\ngray-scale images of \"realistic\" scenes; that means scanned photographs and\\nsimilar material.  JPEG is superior even if you don\\'t have 24-bit display\\nhardware, and it is a LOT superior if you do.  (See section 7 for details.)\\n\\nGIF does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors,\\nsuch as cartoons and line drawings.  In particular, large areas of pixels\\nthat are all *exactly* the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed\\nby GIF.  JPEG can\\'t squeeze these files as much as GIF does without\\nintroducing visible defects.  This sort of image is best kept in GIF form.\\n(In particular, single-color borders are quite cheap in GIF files, but they\\nshould be avoided in JPEG files.)\\n\\nJPEG also has a hard time with very sharp edges: a row of pure-black pixels\\nadjacent to a row of pure-white pixels, for example.  Sharp edges tend to\\ncome out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting.  Again, this\\nsort of thing is not found in scanned photographs, but it shows up fairly\\noften in GIF files: borders, overlaid text, etc.  The blurriness is\\nparticularly objectionable with text that\\'s only a few pixels high.\\nIf you have a GIF with a lot of small-size overlaid text, don\\'t JPEG it.\\n\\nComputer-drawn images (ray-traced scenes, for instance) usually fall between\\nscanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity.  The more complex and\\nsubtly rendered the image, the more likely that JPEG will do well on it.\\nThe same goes for semi-realistic artwork (fantasy drawings and such).\\n\\nPlain black-and-white (two level) images should never be converted to JPEG.\\nYou need at least about 16 gray levels before JPEG is useful for gray-scale\\nimages.  It should also be noted that GIF is lossless for gray-scale images\\nof up to 256 levels, while JPEG is not.\\n\\nIf you have an existing library of GIF images, you may wonder whether you\\nshould convert them to JPEG.  You will lose a little image quality if you do.\\n(Section 7, which argues that JPEG image quality is superior to GIF, only\\napplies if both formats start from a full-color original.  If you start from\\na GIF, you\\'ve already irretrievably lost a great deal of information; JPEG\\ncan only make things worse.)  However, the disk space savings may justify\\nconverting anyway.  This is a decision you\\'ll have to make for yourself.\\nIf you do convert a GIF library to JPEG, see section 14 for hints.  Be\\nprepared to leave some images in GIF format, since some GIFs will not\\nconvert well.\\n\\n\\n[4]  How well does JPEG compress images?\\n\\nPretty darn well.  Here are some sample file sizes for an image I have\\nhandy, a 727x525 full-color image of a ship in a harbor.  The first three\\nfiles are for comparison purposes; the rest were created with the free JPEG\\nsoftware described in section 6B.\\n\\nFile\\t   Size in bytes\\t\\tComments\\n\\nship.ppm\\t1145040  Original file in PPM format (no compression; 24 bits\\n\\t\\t\\t or 3 bytes per pixel, plus a few bytes overhead)\\nship.ppm.Z\\t 963829  PPM file passed through Unix compress\\n\\t\\t\\t compress doesn\\'t accomplish a lot, you\\'ll note.\\n\\t\\t\\t Other text-oriented compressors give similar results.\\nship.gif\\t 240438  Converted to GIF with ppmquant -fs 256 | ppmtogif\\n\\t\\t\\t Most of the savings is the result of losing color\\n\\t\\t\\t info: GIF saves 8 bits/pixel, not 24.  (See sec. 7.)\\n\\nship.jpg95\\t 155622  cjpeg -Q 95    (highest useful quality setting)\\n\\t\\t\\t This is indistinguishable from the 24-bit original,\\n\\t\\t\\t at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs.\\nship.jpg75\\t  58009  cjpeg -Q 75    (default setting)\\n\\t\\t\\t You have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this\\n\\t\\t\\t from the original, even with both on-screen at once.\\nship.jpg50\\t  38406  cjpeg -Q 50\\n\\t\\t\\t This has slight defects; if you know what to look\\n\\t\\t\\t for, you could tell it\\'s been JPEGed without seeing\\n\\t\\t\\t the original.  Still as good image quality as many\\n\\t\\t\\t recent postings in Usenet pictures groups.\\nship.jpg25\\t  25192  cjpeg -Q 25\\n\\t\\t\\t JPEG\\'s characteristic \"blockiness\" becomes apparent\\n\\t\\t\\t at this setting (djpeg -blocksmooth helps some).\\n\\t\\t\\t Still, I\\'ve seen plenty of Usenet postings that were\\n\\t\\t\\t of poorer image quality than this.\\nship.jpg5o\\t   6587  cjpeg -Q 5 -optimize  (-optimize cuts table overhead)\\n\\t\\t\\t Blocky, but perfectly satisfactory for preview or\\n\\t\\t\\t indexing purposes.  Note that this file is TINY:\\n\\t\\t\\t the compression ratio from the original is 173:1 !\\n\\nIn this case JPEG can make a file that\\'s a factor of four or five smaller\\nthan a GIF of comparable quality (the -Q 75 file is every bit as good as the\\nGIF, better if you have a full-color display).  This seems to be a typical\\nratio for real-world scenes.\\n\\n\\n[5]  What are good \"quality\" settings for JPEG?\\n\\nMost JPEG compressors let you pick a file size vs. image quality tradeoff by\\nselecting a quality setting.  There seems to be widespread confusion about\\nthe meaning of these settings.  \"Quality 95\" does NOT mean \"keep 95% of the\\ninformation\", as some have claimed.  The quality scale is purely arbitrary;\\nit\\'s not a percentage of anything.\\n\\nThe name of the game in using JPEG is to pick the lowest quality setting\\n(smallest file size) that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from\\nthe original.  This setting will vary from one image to another and from one\\nobserver to another, but here are some rules of thumb.\\n\\nThe default quality setting (-Q 75) is very often the best choice.  This\\nsetting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a\\ntypical image.  Try -Q 75 first; if you see defects, then go up.  Except for\\nexperimental purposes, never go above -Q 95; saying -Q 100 will produce a\\nfile two or three times as large as -Q 95, but of hardly any better quality.\\n\\nIf the image was less than perfect quality to begin with, you might be able to\\ngo down to -Q 50 without objectionable degradation.  On the other hand, you\\nmight need to go to a HIGHER quality setting to avoid further degradation.\\nThe second case seems to apply much of the time when converting GIFs to JPEG.\\nThe default -Q 75 is about right for compressing 24-bit images, but -Q 85 to\\n95 is usually better for converting GIFs (see section 14 for more info).\\n\\nIf you want a very small file (say for preview or indexing purposes) and are\\nprepared to tolerate large defects, a -Q setting in the range of 5 to 10 is\\nabout right.  -Q 2 or so may be amusing as \"op art\".\\n\\n(Note: the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free JPEG\\nsoftware described in section 6B, and to many programs based on it.  Other\\nJPEG implementations, such as Image Alchemy, may use a completely different\\nquality scale.  Some programs don\\'t even provide a numeric scale, just\\n\"high\"/\"medium\"/\"low\"-style choices.)\\n\\n\\n[6]  Where can I get JPEG software?\\n\\nMost of the programs described in this section are available by FTP.\\nIf you don\\'t know how to use FTP, see the FAQ article \"How to find sources\".\\n(If you don\\'t have direct access to FTP, read about ftpmail servers in the\\nsame article.)

XV reduces all images to 8 bits\\ninternally, which means it\\'s not a real good choice if you have a 24-bit\\ndisplay (you\\'ll still get only 8-bit color).  Also, you shouldn\\'t use XV to\\nconvert full-color images to JPEG, because they\\'ll get color-quantized first.\\nBut XV is a fine tool for converting GIF and other 8-bit images to JPEG.\\nCAUTION: there is a glitch in versions 2.21 and earlier: be sure to check\\nthe \"save at normal size\" checkbox when saving a JPEG file, or the file will\\nbe blurry.\\n\\nAnother good choice for X Windows is John Cristy\\'s free ImageMagick package,\\nalso available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z.\\nThis package handles many image processing and conversion tasks.  The\\nImageMagick viewer handles 24-bit displays correctly; for colormapped\\ndisplays, it does better (though slower) color quantization than XV or the\\nbasic free JPEG software.\\n\\nBoth of the above are large, complex packages.  If you just want a simple\\nimage viewer, try xloadimage or xli.  xloadimage supports JPEG in its latest\\nrelease, 3.03.  xloadimage is free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu,\\nfile contrib/xloadimage.3.03.tar.Z.  xli is a variant version of xloadimage,\\nsaid by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original.\\n(The current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current\\nxloadimage, at least with respect to JPEG files, because it has the IJG v4\\ndecoder while xloadimage 3.03 is using a hacked-over v1.  The next\\nxloadimage release will fix this.)  xli is also free and available from\\nexport.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xli.1.14.tar.Z.  Both programs are said\\nto do the right thing with 24-bit displays.\\n\\n\\nMS-DOS:\\n\\nThis covers plain DOS; for Windows or OS/2 programs, see the next headings.\\n\\nOne good choice is Eric Praetzel\\'s free DVPEG, which views JPEG and GIF files.\\nThe current version, 2.4a, is available by FTP from sunee.uwaterloo.ca\\n(129.97.50.50), file pub/jpeg/viewers/dvpeg24a.zip.  This is a good basic\\nviewer that works on either 286 or 386/486 machines.  The user interface is\\nnot flashy, but it\\'s functional.\\n\\nAnother freeware JPEG/GIF/TGA viewer is Mohammad Rezaei\\'s Hiview.  The\\ncurrent version, 1.2, is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE\\nbelow), file msdos/graphics/hv12.zip.  Hiview requires a 386 or better CPU\\nand a VCPI-compatible memory manager (QEMM386 and 386MAX work; Windows and\\nOS/2 do not).  Hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no\\nbigger than your screen.  For larger images, it scales the image down to fit\\non the screen (rather than using panning/scrolling as most viewers do).\\nYou may or may not prefer this approach, but there\\'s no denying that it\\nslows down loading of large images considerably.  Note: installation is a\\nbit tricky; read the directions carefully!\\n\\nA shareware alternative is ColorView for DOS ($30).  This is easier to\\ninstall than either of the two freeware alternatives.  Its user interface is\\nalso much spiffier-looking, although personally I find it harder to use ---\\nmore keystrokes, inconsistent behavior.  It is faster than DVPEG but a\\nlittle slower than Hiview, at least on my hardware.  (For images larger than\\nscreen size, DVPEG and ColorView seem to be about the same speed, and both\\nare faster than Hiview.)  The current version is 2.1, available from\\nSimtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/dcview21.zip.\\nRequires a VESA graphics driver; if you don\\'t have one, look in vesadrv2.zip\\nor vesa-tsr.zip from the same directory.  (Many recent PCs have a built-in\\nVESA driver, so don\\'t try to load a VESA driver unless ColorView complains\\nthat the driver is missing.)\\n\\nA second shareware alternative is Fullview, which has been kicking around\\nthe net for a while, but I don\\'t know any stable archive location for it.\\nThe current (rather old) version is inferior to the above viewers anyway.\\nThe author tells me that a new version of Fullview will be out shortly\\nand it will be submitted to the Simtel20 archives at that time.\\n\\nThe well-known GIF viewer CompuShow (CSHOW) supports JPEG in its latest\\nrevision, 8.60a.  However, CSHOW\\'s JPEG implementation isn\\'t very good:\\nit\\'s slow (about half the speed of the above viewers) and image quality is\\npoor except on hi-color displays.  Too bad ... it\\'d have been nice to see a\\ngood JPEG capability in CSHOW.  Shareware, $25.  Available from Simtel20 and\\nmirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/gif/cshw860a.zip.\\n\\nDue to the remarkable variety of PC graphics hardware, any one of these\\nviewers might not work on your particular machine.  If you can\\'t get *any*\\nof them to work, you\\'ll need to use one of the following conversion programs\\nto convert JPEG to GIF, then view with your favorite GIF viewer.  (If you\\nhave hi-color hardware, don\\'t use GIF as the intermediate format; try to\\nfind a TARGA-capable viewer instead.  VPIC5.0 is reputed to do the right\\nthing with hi-color displays.)\\n\\nThe Independent JPEG Group\\'s free JPEG converters are FTPable from Simtel20\\nand mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/jpeg4.zip (or\\njpeg4386.zip if you have a 386 and extended memory).  These files are DOS\\ncompilations of the free source code described in section 6B; they will\\nconvert JPEG to and from GIF, Targa, and PPM formats.\\n\\nHandmade Software offers free JPEG<=>GIF conversion tools, GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF.\\nThese are slow and are limited to conversion to and from GIF format; in\\nparticular, you can\\'t get 24-bit color output from a JPEG.  The major\\nadvantage of these tools is that they will read and write HSI\\'s proprietary\\nJPEG format as well as the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Since HSI-format\\nfiles are rather widespread on BBSes, this is a useful capability.  Version\\n2.0 of these tools is free (prior versions were shareware).  Get it from\\nSimtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/gif2jpg2.zip.\\nNOTE: do not use HSI format for files to be posted on Internet, since it is\\nnot readable on non-PC platforms.\\n\\nHandmade Software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulation\\npackage, Image Alchemy.  This will translate JPEG files (both JFIF and HSI\\nformats) to and from many other image formats.  It can also display images.\\nA demo version of Image Alchemy version 1.6.1 is available from Simtel20 and\\nmirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/alch161.zip.\\n\\nNOTE ABOUT SIMTEL20: The Internet\\'s key archive site for PC-related programs\\nis Simtel20, full name wsmr-simtel20.army.mil (192.88.110.20).  Simtel20\\nruns a non-Unix system with weird directory names; where this document\\nrefers to directory (eg) \"msdos/graphics\" at Simtel20, that really means\\n\"pd1:<msdos.graphics>\".  If you are not physically on MILnet, you should\\nexpect rather slow FTP transfer rates from Simtel20.  There are several\\nInternet sites that maintain copies (mirrors) of the Simtel20 archives;\\nmost FTP users should go to one of the mirror sites instead.  A popular USA\\nmirror site is oak.oakland.edu (141.210.10.117), which keeps Simtel20 files\\nin (eg) \"/pub/msdos/graphics\".  If you have no FTP capability, you can\\nretrieve files from Simtel20 by e-mail; see informational postings in\\ncomp.archives.msdos.announce to find out how.  If you are outside the USA,\\nconsult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest Simtel20 mirror is.\\n\\nMicrosoft Windows:\\n\\nThere are several Windows programs capable of displaying JPEG images.\\n(Windows viewers are generally slower than DOS viewers on the same hardware,\\ndue to Windows\\' system overhead.  Note that you can run the DOS conversion\\nprograms described above inside a Windows DOS window.)\\n\\nThe newest entry is WinECJ, which is free and EXTREMELY fast.  Version 1.0\\nis available from ftp.rahul.net, file /pub/bryanw/pc/jpeg/wecj.zip.\\nRequires Windows 3.1 and 256-or-more-colors mode.  This is a no-frills\\nviewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while it\\ndecodes; and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers.\\nBut it\\'s so fast you\\'ll use it anyway, at least for previewing...\\n\\nJView is freeware, fairly fast, has good on-line help, and can write out the\\ndecompressed image in Windows BMP format; but it can\\'t create new JPEG\\nfiles, and it doesn\\'t view GIFs.  JView also lacks some other useful\\nfeatures of the shareware viewers (such as brightness adjustment), but it\\'s\\nan excellent basic viewer.  The current version, 0.9, is available from\\nftp.cica.indiana.edu (129.79.20.84), file pub/pc/win3/desktop/jview090.zip.\\n(Mirrors of this archive can be found at some other Internet sites,\\nincluding wuarchive.wustl.edu.)\\n\\nWinJPEG (shareware, $20) displays JPEG,GIF,Targa,TIFF, and BMP image files;\\nit can write all of these formats too, so it can be used as a converter.\\nIt has some other nifty features including color-balance adjustment and\\nslideshow.  The current version is 2.1, available from Simtel20 and mirror\\nsites (see NOTE above), file msdos/windows3/winjp210.zip.  (This is a slow\\n286-compatible version; if you register, you\\'ll get the 386-only version,\\nwhich is roughly 25% faster.)\\n\\nColorView is another shareware entry ($30).  This was an early and promising\\ncontender, but it has not been updated in some time, and at this point it\\nhas no real advantages over WinJPEG.  If you want to try it anyway, the\\ncurrent version is 0.97, available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu, file\\npub/pc/win3/desktop/cview097.zip.  (I understand that a new version will\\nbe appearing once the authors are finished with ColorView for DOS.)\\n\\nDVPEG (see DOS heading) also works under Windows, but only in full-screen\\nmode, not in a window.\\n\\nOS/2:\\n\\nThe following files are available from hobbes.nmsu.edu (128.123.35.151).\\nNote: check /pub/uploads for more recent versions --- the hobbes moderator\\nis not very fast about moving uploads into their permanent directories.\\n/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/jpegv4.zip\\n    32-bit version of free IJG conversion programs, version 4.\\n/pub/os2/all/graphics/jpeg4-16.zip\\n    16-bit version of same, for OS/2 1.x.\\n/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/imgarc11.zip\\n    Image Archiver 1.01: image conversion/viewing with PM graphical interface.\\n    Strong on conversion functions, viewing is a bit weaker.

GIF viewing very fast, JPEG viewing\\n    fast if you have huge amounts of RAM, otherwise about the same speed\\n    as the above programs.  Strong 24-bit display support.  Shareware, $20.\\n\\nMacintosh:\\n\\nMost Mac JPEG programs rely on Apple\\'s JPEG implementation, which is part of\\nthe QuickTime system extension; so you need to have QuickTime installed.\\nTo use QuickTime, you need a 68020 or better CPU and you need to be running\\nSystem 6.0.7 or later.  (If you\\'re running System 6, you must also install\\nthe 32-bit QuickDraw extension; this is built-in on System 7.)  You can get\\nQuickTime by FTP from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/quicktime.hqx.\\n(As of 11/92, this file contains QuickTime 1.5, which is better than QT 1.0\\nin several ways.  With respect to JPEG, it is marginally faster and\\nconsiderably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt JPEG file.  However,\\nsome applications seem to have compatibility problems with QT 1.5.)\\n\\nMac users should keep in mind that QuickTime\\'s JPEG format, PICT/JPEG, is\\nnot the same as the Usenet-standard JFIF JPEG format.  (See section 10 for\\ndetails.)  If you post images on Usenet, make sure they are in JFIF format.\\nMost of the programs mentioned below can generate either format.\\n\\nThe first choice is probably JPEGView, a free program for viewing images\\nthat are in JFIF format, PICT/JPEG format, or GIF format.  It also can\\nconvert between the two JPEG formats.  The current version, 2.0, is a big\\nimprovement over prior versions.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu\\n(36.44.0.6), file /info-mac/app/jpeg-view-20.hqx.  Requires System 7 and\\nQuickTime.  On 8-bit displays, JPEGView usually produces the best color\\nimage quality of all the currently available Mac JPEG viewers.  JPEGView can\\nview large images in much less memory than other Mac viewers; in fact, it\\'s\\nthe only one that can deal with JPEG images much over 640x480 pixels on a\\ntypical 4MB Mac.  Given a large image, JPEGView automatically scales it down\\nto fit on the screen, rather than presenting scroll bars like most other\\nviewers.  (You can zoom in on any desired portion, though.)  Some people\\nlike this behavior, some don\\'t.  Overall, JPEGView\\'s user interface is very\\nwell thought out.\\n\\nGIFConverter, a shareware ($40) image viewer/converter, supports JFIF and\\nPICT/JPEG, as well as GIF and several other image formats.  The latest\\nversion is 2.3.2.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file\\n/info-mac/art/gif/gif-converter-232.hqx.  Requires System 6.0.5 or later.\\nGIFConverter is not better than JPEGView as a plain JPEG/GIF viewer, but\\nit has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion\\ncapabilities, so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of\\nplaying around with images.  Also, the newest version of GIFConverter can\\nload and save JFIF images *without* QuickTime, so it is your best bet if\\nyour machine is too old to run QuickTime.  (But it\\'s faster with QuickTime.)\\nNote: If GIFConverter runs out of memory trying to load a large JPEG, try\\nconverting the file to GIF with JPEG Convert, then viewing the GIF version.\\n\\nJPEG Convert, a Mac version of the free IJG JPEG conversion utilities, is\\navailable from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/jpeg-convert-10.hqx.\\nThis will run on any Mac, but it only does file conversion, not viewing.\\nYou can use it in conjunction with any GIF viewer.\\n\\nPrevious versions of this FAQ recommended Imagery JPEG v0.6, a JPEG<=>GIF\\nconverter based on an old version of the IJG code.  If you are using this\\nprogram, you definitely should replace it with JPEG Convert.\\n\\nApple\\'s free program PictPixie can view images in JFIF, QuickTime JPEG, and\\nGIF format, and can convert between these formats.  You can get PictPixie\\nfrom ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/qt.1.0.stuff/pictpixie.hqx.\\nRequires QuickTime.  PictPixie was intended as a developer\\'s tool, and it\\'s\\nreally not the best choice unless you like to fool around with QuickTime.\\nSome of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory, it produces\\nrelatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 24-bit display,\\nand it has a relatively unfriendly user interface.  Worse, PictPixie is an\\nunsupported program, meaning it has some minor bugs that Apple does not\\nintend to fix.  (There is an old version of PictPixie, called\\nPICTCompressor, floating around the net.  If you have this you should trash\\nit, as it\\'s even buggier.  Also, the QuickTime Starter Kit includes a much\\ncleaned-up descendant of PictPixie called Picture Compressor.  Note that\\nPicture Compressor is NOT free and may not be distributed on the net.)\\n\\nStorm Technology\\'s Picture Decompress is a free JPEG viewer/converter.\\nThis rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways, but\\nit will run without System 7 or QuickTime, so you may be forced to use it on\\nolder systems.  (It does need 32-bit QuickDraw, so really old machines can\\'t\\nuse it.)  You can get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file\\n/info-mac/app/picture-decompress-201.hqx.  You must set the file type of a\\ndownloaded image file to \\'JPEG\\' to allow Picture Decompress to open it.\\n\\nIf your machine is too old to run 32-bit QuickDraw (a Mac Plus for instance),\\nGIFConverter is your only choice for single-program JPEG viewing.  If you\\ndon\\'t want to pay for GIFConverter, use JPEG Convert and a free GIF viewer.\\n\\nMore and more commercial Mac applications are supporting JPEG, although not\\nall can deal with the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Adobe Photoshop, version\\n2.0.1 or later, can read and write JFIF-format JPEG files (use the JPEG\\nplug-in from the Acquire menu).  You must set the file type of a downloaded\\nJPEG file to \\'JPEG\\' to allow Photoshop to recognize it.\\n\\nAmiga:\\n\\n(Most programs listed in this section are stored in the AmiNet archive at\\namiga.physik.unizh.ch (130.60.80.80).  There are many mirror sites of this\\narchive and you should try to use the closest one.  In the USA, a good\\nchoice is wuarchive.wustl.edu; look under /mirrors/amiga.physik.unizh.ch/...)\\n\\nHamLab Plus is an excellent JPEG viewer/converter, as well as being a\\ngeneral image manipulation tool.  It\\'s cheap (shareware, $20) and can read\\nseveral formats besides JPEG.  The current version is 2.0.8.  A demo version\\nis available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file\\namiga/gfx/edit/hamlab208d.lha.  The demo version will crop images larger\\nthan 512x512, but it is otherwise fully functional.\\n\\nRend24 (shareware, $30) is an image renderer that can display JPEG, ILBM,\\nand GIF images.  The program can be used to create animations, even\\ncapturing frames on-the-fly from rendering packages like Lightwave.  The\\ncurrent version is 1.05, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror\\nsites), file amiga/os30/gfx/rend105.lha.  (Note: although this directory is\\nsupposedly for AmigaDOS 3.0 programs, the program will also run under\\nAmigaDOS 1.3, 2.04 or 2.1.)\\n\\nViewtek is a free JPEG/ILBM/GIF/ANIM viewer.  The current version is 1.04,\\navailable from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file\\namiga/gfx/show/ViewTek104.lha.\\n\\nIf you\\'re willing to spend real money, there are several commercial packages\\nthat support JPEG.  Two are written by Thomas Krehbiel, the author of Rend24\\nand Viewtek.  These are CineMorph, a standalone image morphing package, and\\nImageFX, an impressive 24-bit image capture, conversion, editing, painting,\\neffects and prepress package that also includes CineMorph.  Both are\\ndistributed by Great Valley Products.  Art Department Professional (ADPro),\\nfrom ASDG Inc, is the most widely used commercial image manipulation\\nsoftware for Amigas.  ImageMaster, from Black Belt Systems, is another\\nwell-regarded commercial graphics package with JPEG support.\\n\\nThe free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Amigas from\\namiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites) in directory amiga/gfx/conv, file\\nAmigaJPEGV4.lha.  These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM,GIF,Targa formats.\\n\\nThe Amiga world is heavily infested with quick-and-dirty JPEG programs, many\\nbased on an ancient beta-test version of the free IJG JPEG software (thanks\\nto a certain magazine that published same on its disk-of-the-month, without\\nso much as notifying the authors).  Among these are \"AugJPEG\", \"NewAmyJPEG\",\\n\"VJPEG\", and probably others I have not even heard of.  In my opinion,\\nanything older than IJG version 3 (March 1992) is not worth the disk space\\nit\\'s stored on; if you have such a program, trash it and get something newer.\\n\\nAtari ST:\\n\\nThe free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Atari ST, TT, etc,\\nfrom atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/jpeg4bin.zoo.\\nThese programs convert JPEG to/from PPM, GIF, Targa formats.\\n\\nI have not heard of any free or shareware JPEG-capable viewer for Ataris,\\nbut surely there must be one by now?  Pointers appreciated.\\n\\nAcorn Archimedes:\\n\\n!ChangeFSI, supplied with RISC OS 3 version 3.10, can convert from and view\\nJPEG JFIF format.  Provision is also made to convert images to JPEG,\\nalthough this must be done from the CLI rather than by double-clicking.\\n\\nRecent versions (since 7.11) of the shareware program Translator can handle\\nJPEG, along with about 30 other image formats.  While older versions can be\\nfound on some Archimedes bboards, the current version is only available by\\nregistering with the author, John Kortink, Nutterbrink 31, 7544 WJ, Enschede,\\nThe Netherlands.  Price 35 Dutch guilders (about $22 or 10 pounds).\\n\\nThere\\'s also a commercial product called !JPEG which provides JPEG read/write\\nfunctionality and direct JPEG viewing, as well as a host of other image\\nformat conversion and processing options.  This is more expensive but not\\nnecessarily better than the above programs.  Contact: DT Software, FREEPOST,\\nCambridge, UK.  Tel: 0223 841099.\\n\\n\\nPortable software for almost any system:\\n\\nIf none of the above fits your situation, you can obtain and compile the free\\nJPEG conversion software described in 6B.  You\\'ll also need a viewer program.\\nIf your display is 8 bits or less, any GIF viewer will do fine; if you have a\\ndisplay with more color capability, try to find a viewer that can read Targa\\nor PPM 24-bit image files.\\n\\nThere are numerous commercial JPEG offerings, with more popping up every\\nday.  I recommend that you not spend money on one of these unless you find\\nthe available free or shareware software vastly too slow.  In that case,\\npurchase a hardware-assisted product.  Ask pointed questions about whether\\nthe product complies with the final JPEG standard and about whether it can\\nhandle the JFIF file format; many of the earliest commercial releases are\\nnot and never will be compatible with anyone else\\'s files.\\n\\n\\n[6B]  If you are looking for source code to work with:\\n\\nFree, portable C code for JPEG compression is available from the Independent\\nJPEG Group, which I lead.

You can retrieve this file by FTP or UUCP.\\nIf you are on a PC and don\\'t know how to cope with .tar.Z format, you may\\nprefer ZIP format, which you can find at Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE\\nabove), file msdos/graphics/jpegsrc4.zip.  This file will also be available on\\nCompuServe, in the GRAPHSUPPORT forum (GO PICS), library 15, as jpsrc4.zip.\\nIf you have no FTP access, you can retrieve the source from your nearest\\ncomp.sources.misc archive; version 4 appeared as issues 55-72 of volume 34.\\n(If you don\\'t know how to retrieve comp.sources.misc postings, see the FAQ\\narticle \"How to find sources\", referred to at the top of section 6.)\\n\\nThe free JPEG code provides conversion between JPEG \"JFIF\" format and image\\nfiles in GIF, PBMPLUS PPM/PGM, Utah RLE, and Truevision Targa file formats.\\nThe core compression and decompression modules can easily be reused in other\\nprograms, such as image viewers.

To display a full-color image, the\\ncomputer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative\\ncolors.  This process is called \"color quantization\".  (This is something\\nof a misnomer, \"color selection\" would be a better term.  We\\'re stuck with\\nthe standard usage though.)\\n\\nClearly, color quantization is a lossy process.  It turns out that for most\\nimages, the details of the color quantization algorithm have MUCH more impact\\non the final image quality than do any errors introduced by JPEG (except at\\nthe very lowest JPEG quality settings).\\n\\nSince JPEG is a full-color format, converting a color JPEG image for display\\non 8-bit-or-less hardware requires color quantization.  This is true for\\n*all* color JPEGs: even if you feed a 256-or-less-color GIF into JPEG, what\\ncomes out of the decompressor is *not* 256 colors, but thousands of colors.\\nThis happens because JPEG\\'s lossiness affects each pixel a little\\ndifferently, so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably\\ncome out with slightly different colors.  Each original color gets \"smeared\"\\ninto a group of nearby colors.  Therefore quantization is always required to\\ndisplay a color JPEG on a colormapped display, regardless of the image\\nsource.  The only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray-scale output.\\n\\n(Incidentally, because of this effect it\\'s nearly meaningless to talk about\\nthe number of colors used by a JPEG image.  Even if you attempted to count\\nthe number of distinct pixel values, different JPEG decoders would give you\\ndifferent results because of roundoff error differences.  I occasionally see\\nposted images described as \"256-color JPEG\".  This tells me that the poster\\n(a) hasn\\'t read this FAQ and (b) probably converted the JPEG from a GIF.\\nJPEGs can be classified as color or gray-scale (just like photographs), but\\nnumber of colors just isn\\'t a useful concept for JPEG.)\\n\\nOn the other hand, a GIF image by definition has already been quantized to\\n256 or fewer colors.  (A GIF *does* have a definite number of colors in its\\npalette, and the format doesn\\'t allow more than 256 palette entries.)\\nFor purposes of Usenet picture distribution, GIF has the advantage that the\\nsender precomputes the color quantization, so recipients don\\'t have to.\\nThis is also the *disadvantage* of GIF: you\\'re stuck with the sender\\'s\\nquantization.  If the sender quantized to a different number of colors than\\nwhat you can display, you have to re-quantize, resulting in much poorer\\nimage quality than if you had quantized once from a full-color image.\\nFurthermore, if the sender didn\\'t use a high-quality color quantization\\nalgorithm, you\\'re out of luck.\\n\\nFor this reason, JPEG offers the promise of significantly better image quality\\nfor all users whose machines don\\'t match the sender\\'s display hardware.\\nJPEG\\'s full color image can be quantized to precisely match the user\\'s display\\nhardware.  Furthermore, you will be able to take advantage of future\\nimprovements in quantization algorithms (there is a lot of active research in\\nthis area), or purchase better display hardware, to get a better view of JPEG\\nimages you already have.  With a GIF, you\\'re stuck forevermore with what was\\nsent.\\n\\nIt\\'s also worth mentioning that many GIF-viewing programs include rather\\nshoddy quantization routines.  If you view a 256-color GIF on a 16-color EGA\\ndisplay, for example, you are probably getting a much worse image than you\\nneed to.  This is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color\\nquantizations (one to create the GIF, one to display it), but often it\\'s\\nalso due to sloppiness.  JPEG conversion programs will be forced to use\\nhigh quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all, and in\\nnormal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be\\ndisplayed.  Thus, JPEG is likely to provide better results than the average\\nGIF program for low-color-resolution displays as well as high-resolution ones!\\n\\nFinally, an ever-growing number of people have better-than-8-bit display\\nhardware already: 15-bit \"hi-color\" PC displays, true 24-bit displays on\\nworkstations and Macintoshes, etc.  For these people, GIF is already\\nobsolete, as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of their\\ndisplay.  JPEG images can drive these displays much more effectively.\\nThus, JPEG is an all-around better choice than GIF for representing images\\nin a machine-independent fashion.\\n\\n\\n[8]  How does JPEG work?\\n\\nThe buzz-words to know are chrominance subsampling, discrete cosine\\ntransforms, coefficient quantization, and Huffman or arithmetic entropy\\ncoding.  This article\\'s long enough already, so I\\'m not going to say more\\nthan that here.  For technical information, see the comp.compression FAQ.\\nThis is available from the news.answers archive at rtfm.mit.edu, in files\\n/pub/usenet/news.answers/compression-faq/part[1-3].  If you need help in\\nusing the news.answers archive, see the top of this article.\\n\\n\\n[9]  What about lossless JPEG?\\n\\nThere\\'s a great deal of confusion on this subject.  The JPEG committee did\\ndefine a truly lossless compression algorithm, i.e., one that guarantees the\\nfinal output is bit-for-bit identical to the original input.  However, this\\nlossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular, lossy JPEG\\nalgorithm, and it offers much less compression.  At present, very few\\nimplementations of lossless JPEG exist, and all of them are commercial.\\n\\nSaying \"-Q 100\" to the free JPEG software DOES NOT get you a lossless image.\\nWhat it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient\\nquantization step.  There is still a good deal of information loss in the\\ncolor subsampling step.  (With the V4 free JPEG code, you can also say\\n\"-sample 1x1\" to turn off subsampling.  Keep in mind that many commercial\\nJPEG implementations cannot cope with the resulting file.)\\n\\nEven with both quantization and subsampling turned off, the regular JPEG\\nalgorithm is not lossless, because it is subject to roundoff errors in\\nvarious calculations.  The maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel\\nvalue; it\\'s highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye,\\nbut it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image.\\n\\nAt this minimum-loss setting, regular JPEG produces files that are perhaps\\nhalf the size of an uncompressed 24-bit-per-pixel image.  True lossless JPEG\\nprovides roughly the same amount of compression, but it guarantees\\nbit-for-bit accuracy.\\n\\nIf you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less\\nthan 6 bits per pixel (per color component), you may want to look into the\\nJBIG bilevel image compression standard.  This performs better than JPEG\\nlossless on such images.  JPEG lossless is superior to JBIG on images with\\n6 or more bits per pixel; furthermore, JPEG is public domain (at least with a\\nHuffman back end), while the JBIG techniques are heavily covered by patents.\\n\\n\\n[10]  Why all the argument about file formats?\\n\\nStrictly speaking, JPEG refers only to a family of compression algorithms;\\nit does *not* refer to a specific image file format.  The JPEG committee was\\nprevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international\\nstandards organizations.\\n\\nSince we can\\'t actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on\\na common file format, this leaves us with a problem.  In the absence of\\nofficial standards, a number of JPEG program writers have just gone off to\\n\"do their own thing\", and as a result their programs aren\\'t compatible with\\nanybody else\\'s.\\n\\nThe closest thing we have to a de-facto standard JPEG format is some work\\nthat\\'s been coordinated by people at C-Cube Microsystems.  They have defined\\ntwo JPEG-based file formats:\\n  * JFIF (JPEG File Interchange Format), a \"low-end\" format that transports\\n    pixels and not much else.\\n  * TIFF/JPEG, aka TIFF 6.0, an extension of the Aldus TIFF format.  TIFF is\\n    a \"high-end\" format that will let you record just about everything you\\n    ever wanted to know about an image, and a lot more besides :-).  TIFF is\\n    a lot more complex than JFIF, and may well prove less transportable,\\n    because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different\\n    and incompatible subsets of TIFF.  It\\'s not likely that adding JPEG to the\\n    mix will do anything to improve this situation.\\nBoth of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors\\nof JPEG-related products; it\\'s reasonably likely that future commercial\\nproducts will adhere to one or both standards.\\n\\nI believe that Usenet should adopt JFIF as the replacement for GIF in\\npicture postings.  JFIF is simpler than TIFF and is available now; the\\nTIFF 6.0 spec has only recently been officially adopted, and it is still\\nunusably vague on some crucial details.  Even when TIFF/JPEG is well\\ndefined, the JFIF format is likely to be a widely supported \"lowest common\\ndenominator\"; TIFF/JPEG files may never be as transportable.\\n\\nA particular case that people may be interested in is Apple\\'s QuickTime\\nsoftware for the Macintosh.  QuickTime uses a JFIF-compatible format wrapped\\ninside the Mac-specific PICT structure.  Conversion between JFIF and\\nQuickTime JPEG is pretty straightforward, and several Mac programs are\\navailable to do it (see Mac portion of section 6A).  If you have an editor\\nthat handles binary files, you can strip a QuickTime JPEG PICT down to JFIF\\nby hand; see section 11 for details.\\n\\nAnother particular case is Handmade Software\\'s programs (GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF and\\nImage Alchemy).  These programs are capable of reading and writing JFIF\\nformat.  By default, though, they write a proprietary format developed by\\nHSI.  This format is NOT readable by any non-HSI programs and should not be\\nused for Usenet postings.  Use the -j switch to get JFIF output.  (This\\napplies to old versions of these programs; the current releases emit JFIF\\nformat by default.  You still should be careful not to post HSI-format\\nfiles, unless you want to get flamed by people on non-PC platforms.)\\n\\n\\n[11]  How do I recognize which file format I have, and what do I do about it?\\n\\nIf you have an alleged JPEG file that your software won\\'t read, it\\'s likely\\nto be HSI format or some other proprietary JPEG-based format.  You can tell\\nwhat you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file:\\n\\n1.  A JFIF-standard file will start with the characters (hex) FF D8 FF E0,\\n    followed by two variable bytes (often hex 00 10), followed by \\'JFIF\\'.\\n\\n2.  If you see FF D8 at the start, but not the rest of it, you may have a\\n    \"raw JPEG\" file.  This is probably decodable as-is by JFIF software ---\\n    it\\'s worth a try, anyway.\\n\\n3.  HSI files start with \\'hsi1\\'.  You\\'re out of luck unless you have HSI\\n    software.  Portions of the file may look like plain JPEG data, but they\\n    won\\'t decompress properly with non-HSI programs.\\n\\n4.  A Macintosh PICT file, if JPEG-compressed, will have a couple hundred\\n    bytes of header followed by a JFIF header (scan for \\'JFIF\\').  Strip off\\n    everything before the FF D8 and you should be able to read it.\\n\\n5.  Anything else: it\\'s a proprietary format, or not JPEG at all.  If you are\\n    lucky, the file may consist of a header and a raw JPEG data stream.\\n    If you can identify the start of the JPEG data stream (look for FF D8),\\n    try stripping off everything before that.\\n\\nIn uuencoded Usenet postings, the characteristic JFIF pattern is\\n\\n\\t\"begin\" line\\n\\tM_]C_X ...\\n\\nwhereas uuencoded HSI files will start with\\n\\n\\t\"begin\" line\\n\\tM:\\'-I ...\\n\\nIf you learn to check for the former, you can save yourself the trouble of\\ndownloading non-JFIF files.\\n\\n\\n[12]  What about arithmetic coding?\\n\\nThe JPEG spec defines two different \"back end\" modules for the final output\\nof compressed data: either Huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed.\\nThe choice has no impact on image quality, but arithmetic coding usually\\nproduces a smaller compressed file.  On typical images, arithmetic coding\\nproduces a file 5 or 10 percent smaller than Huffman coding.  (All the\\nfile-size numbers previously cited are for Huffman coding.)\\n\\nUnfortunately, the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the\\nJPEG standard is subject to patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi.\\nThus *you cannot legally use arithmetic coding* unless you obtain licenses\\nfrom these companies.  (The \"fair use\" doctrine allows people to implement\\nand test the algorithm, but actually storing any images with it is dubious\\nat best.)\\n\\nAt least in the short run, I recommend that people not worry about\\narithmetic coding; the space savings isn\\'t great enough to justify the\\npotential legal hassles.  In particular, arithmetic coding *should not*\\nbe used for any images to be exchanged on Usenet.\\n\\nThere is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the\\nfuture.  Stay tuned for further details.\\n\\n\\n[13]  Does loss accumulate with repeated compression/decompression?\\n\\nIt would be nice if, having compressed an image with JPEG, you could\\ndecompress it, manipulate it (crop off a border, say), and recompress it\\nwithout any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially.\\nUnfortunately THIS IS NOT THE CASE.  In general, recompressing an altered\\nimage loses more information, though usually not as much as was lost the\\nfirst time around.\\n\\nThe next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress\\nit *without changing it* then there is no further loss, i.e., you get an\\nidentical JPEG file.  Even this is not true; at least, not with the current\\nfree JPEG software.  It\\'s essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff\\nerror.  If you repeatedly compress and decompress, the image will eventually\\ndegrade to where you can see visible changes from the first-generation\\noutput.  (It usually takes many such cycles to get visible change.)\\nOne of the things on our to-do list is to see if accumulation of error can\\nbe avoided or limited, but I am not optimistic about it.\\n\\nIn any case, the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that\\ncompressing the unmodified full-color output of djpeg, at the original\\nquality setting, would introduce no further loss.  Even such simple changes\\nas cropping off a border could cause further roundoff-error degradation.\\n(If you\\'re wondering why, it\\'s because the pixel-block boundaries move.\\nIf you cropped off only multiples of 16 pixels, you might be safe, but\\nthat\\'s a mighty limited capability!)\\n\\nThe bottom line is that JPEG is a useful format for archival storage and\\ntransmission of images, but you don\\'t want to use it as an intermediate\\nformat for sequences of image manipulation steps.  Use a lossless format\\n(PPM, RLE, TIFF, etc) while working on the image, then JPEG it when you are\\nready to file it away.  Aside from avoiding degradation, you will save a lot\\nof compression/decompression time this way :-).\\n\\n\\n[14]  What are some rules of thumb for converting GIF images to JPEG?\\n\\nAs stated earlier, you *will* lose some amount of image information if you\\nconvert an existing GIF image to JPEG.  If you can obtain the original\\nfull-color data the GIF was made from, it\\'s far better to make a JPEG from\\nthat.  But if you need to save space and have only the GIF to work from,\\nhere are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum\\nloss of quality.\\n\\nThe first rule when converting a GIF library is to look at each JPEG, to\\nmake sure you are happy with it, before throwing away the corresponding GIF;\\nthat will give you a chance to re-do the conversion with a higher quality\\nsetting if necessary.  Some GIFs may be better left as GIFs, as explained in\\nsection 3; in particular, cartoon-type GIFs with sixteen or fewer colors\\ndon\\'t convert well.  You may find that a JPEG file of reasonable quality\\nwill be *larger* than the GIF.  (So check the sizes too.)\\n\\nExperience to date suggests that large, high-visual-quality GIFs are the best\\ncandidates for conversion to JPEG.  They chew up the most storage so offer\\nthe most potential savings, and they convert to JPEG with least degradation.\\nDon\\'t waste your time converting any GIF much under 100 Kbytes.  Also, don\\'t\\nexpect JPEG files converted from GIFs to be as small as those created\\ndirectly from full-color originals.  To maintain image quality you may have\\nto let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight-through\\nJPEG files would be (i.e., shoot for 1/2 or 1/3rd the size of the GIF file,\\nnot 1/4th as suggested in earlier comparisons).\\n\\nMany people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant-color\\nborder around a GIF image.  While useless, this was nearly free in terms of\\nstorage cost in GIF files.  It is NOT free in JPEG files, and the sharp\\nborder boundary can create visible artifacts (\"ghost\" edges).  Do yourself\\na favor and crop off any border before JPEGing.  (If you are on an X Windows\\nsystem, XV\\'s manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless\\nway to do this.)\\n\\ncjpeg\\'s default Q setting of 75 is appropriate for full-color input, but\\nfor GIF inputs, Q settings of 85 to 95 often seem to be necessary to avoid\\nimage degradation.  (If you apply smoothing as suggested below, the higher\\nQ setting may not be necessary.)\\n\\nColor GIFs of photographs or complex artwork are usually \"dithered\" to fool\\nyour eye into seeing more than the 256 colors that GIF can actually store.\\nIf you enlarge the image, you will see that adjacent pixels are often of\\nsignificantly different colors; at normal size the eye averages these pixels\\ntogether to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value.  The\\ntrouble with dithering is that, to JPEG, it looks like high-spatial-frequency\\ncolor noise; and JPEG can\\'t compress noise very well.  The resulting JPEG\\nfile is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have\\ngotten from JPEGing the original full color image (if you had it).\\nTo get around this, you want to \"smooth\" the GIF image before compression.\\nSmoothing averages together nearby pixels, thus approximating the color that\\nyou thought you saw anyway, and in the process getting rid of the rapid\\ncolor changes that give JPEG trouble.  Appropriate use of smoothing will\\noften let you avoid using a high Q factor, thus further reducing the size of\\nthe compressed file, while still obtaining a better-looking output image\\nthan you\\'d get without smoothing.\\n\\nWith the V4 free JPEG software (or products based on it), a simple smoothing\\ncapability is built in.  Try \"-smooth 10\" or so when converting GIFs.\\nValues of 10 to 25 seem to work well for high-quality GIFs.  Heavy-handed\\ndithering may require larger smoothing factors.  (If you can see regular\\nfine-scale patterns on the GIF image even without enlargement, then strong\\nsmoothing is definitely called for.)  Too large a smoothing factor will blur\\nthe output image, which you don\\'t want.  If you are an image processing\\nwizard, you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program, such as\\npnmconvol from the PBMPLUS package.  However, cjpeg\\'s built-in smoother is\\na LOT faster than pnmconvol...\\n\\nThe upshot of all this is that \"cjpeg -quality 85 -smooth 10\" is probably a\\ngood starting point for converting GIFs.  But if you really care about the\\nimage, you\\'ll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings.\\n\\n\\n---------------------\\n\\nFor more information about JPEG in general or the free JPEG software in\\nparticular, contact the Independent JPEG Group at jpeg-info@uunet.uu.net.\\n',\n",

       " 'I\\'m asking for help on a sticky problem involving unreasonably low\\napparent precision in Z-buffering, that I\\'ve encountered in 2 different\\nPEX implementations.  I can\\'t find any discussion of this problem in any\\nresources I can lay hands on (e.g. the comp.windows.x.pex FAQ, Gaskins\\'s\\n_PEXlib_Programming_Manual_, vendors\\' documentation).\\n\\nI\\'m posting this article by itself on comp.graphics, and virtually the\\nsame article with a test program demonstrating the problem on\\ncomp.windows.x.pex.  The problem is hard to describe without pictures,\\nhence this article is longish.  If you can run PEXlib 5.x programs and\\nare interested, I encourage you to build and run the test program in\\ncomp.windows.x.pex to see the effect yourself and play with my approach\\nto dealing with it.  (It depends on the utility code from the above\\nGaskins book; instructions for fetching it via anonymous FTP are given.)\\n\\nThe problem to be solved is to eliminate or minimize \"stitching\"\\nartifacts resulting from the use of Z-buffering with polylines that are\\ncoplanar with filled areas.  The interpolated Z values along a line will\\ndiffer slightly, due to roundoff error, from the interpolated Z values\\nacross an area, even when the endpoints of the line are coincident with\\nvertices of the area.  Because of this, it\\'s a tossup whether the\\nZ-buffer will allow the line pixels or the area pixels to be displayed.\\nVisually, the result tends to be a dashed-line effect even though the\\nline is supposed to be solid.\\n\\nUsing the PEXlib API, my approach to a solution is to use two slightly\\ndifferent PEX view mapping transforms, in two view table entries, one\\nfor the areas and one for the lines.  The PEX structures or immediate-\\nmode output must be organized so that one view table index is always in\\neffect for areas, and the other is always in effect for lines.  The\\nresult is a slight shift in NPC Z coordinates for the lines, so as to\\nattempt to bias the tossup situations in favor of the lines.\\n\\nThis shift is effected by moving the front and back clipping planes used\\nin the PEXlib view table entry for lines just a hair \"backwards\" (i.e.\\nsmaller VRC Z coordinates), compared to their positions in the view\\ntable entry used for areas.  This means that when a point is transformed\\nto NPC, its Z value will be slightly bigger if it comes from a line than\\nif it comes from an area, thus accomplishing the desired bias.\\n\\nI would expect the Z roundoff errors which cause the problem to amount\\nto a few units at most, out of the entire dynamic range of the Z-buffer,\\ntypically from 0 to 65535 if not 16777215 (i.e. 16 or 24 bit Z-buffers).\\nTherefore, it seems that a tiny fraction of the range of Z in VRC\\nbetween the front and back clip planes ought to suffice to reliably fix\\nthe stitching.\\n\\nBut in fact, experience shows that the shift has to be as much as 0.003\\nto 0.006 of the range.  (Empirically, it\\'s worst when the NPC Z\\ncomponent of the slope of the surface is high, i.e. when it appears more\\nor less edge-on to the viewer.)  It\\'s as if only 8 or 9 bits of the\\nZ-buffer have any dependable meaning!  This amount is so great that one\\nproblem is replaced by another: sometimes the polylines \"show through\"\\nareas which they are supposed to lie behind.\\n\\nI\\'ve observed the problem on both Hewlett-Packard and Digital\\nworkstation PEX servers, to approximately the same degree.

       " '\\nAs a general rule, no relay will cleanly switch audio if you try to tranfer\\nthe circuit with the contacts.  The noise you hear is due to the momentary\\nopening and closing of the path.\\n\\nThe noiseless way of transfering audio is to ground the circuit.  In high\\nimpedance audio circuits a resistive \"T\" is constructed close to characteristic\\nimpedance of the circuit.  Grounding the imputs (connected to the T) transfers\\nthe audio.\\n\\nIn low impedance circuits transformers are usually used, and the inputs are\\nshorted out or grounded.  Secondaries are paralleled at the characteristic\\nimpedance.\\n\\nSometimes if it is necessary to actually switch audio, a second contact is used\\nto momentarily short the circuit output for the duration of the switching time.\\n\\nTelephone relays are handy, because contacts can be adjusted to \"Make before\\nbreak and Vica Versa\" but I haven\\'t seen any of these for years.\\n\\nNowadys switching is done electronically with OP amps, etc.\\n\\nA novel circuit I used to build was a primitive \"optical isolator\".. It consists\\nof a resistive photocell and a lamp, all packaged in a tube.  When the lamp is\\noff the cell is high resistance.  Turn the lamp on and the resistance lowers\\npassing the audio.

       " \"There is a cartridge capping upgrade for older deskjet printers\\navailable from hewlett-packard.  Older original deskjet and\\npossibly deskjet 500 units may have a black plastic slide with\\nrubber capping components in the cartrige parking area on the right\\nside (viewed from front) of the printer.  Newer printers have a\\ngray or white plastic slide.  The black plastic slide can allow\\nyour cartridge to dry out.  There was and may still be information\\npackaged with ink cartridges explaining the situation.  HP placed a\\ncoupon for a free upgrade kit to modernize old deskjets to the new\\ncapping mechanism.  I did this on my printer and did indeed find\\nthat the cartidges now last longer.\\n\\nI don't have the information handy.  I suggest contacting your\\nnearest HP service center for information on obtaining the kit.\\n\\nHP has upgrade kits that consist of electronics and mechanical\\ncomponents that vary depending on the starting level printer and\\nthe level to which you wish to upgrade.  I upgraded my original\\ndesket to a dekjet 500.  The kit was fairly expensive.  You are\\nlikely better off selling your old printer and purchasing a new\\ndeskjet 500 now that prices have declined so much.  Upgrading an\\noriginal deskjet to 500 requires a fair amount of skill, but no\\nsoldering.  Upgrading a deskjet plus to a 500 is involves swapping\\nthe processor card and changing a few minor parts.  Contact your HP\\nservice center for further information.\\n\\nThe PCL language used by Deskjets is considerably different from\\nthe PCL used by laser printers, especially the newer laser\\nprinters.  The biggest problem is dumb laser drivers that send a\\nraster end command after each scan line.  This makes no material\\ndifference for lasers, but causes the deskjet to print the\\naccumulated raster.  As you might guess, the result is hideously\\nslow printing.  The new DOS Wordperfect print deskjet drivers are\\nstill guilty of this particular behavior.  From the way Wordperfect\\nworks, this would not be easy to change.  Windows Wordperfect works\\nefficiently unless you use the DOS drivers instead of Windows'.\\n\\nThe PCL4 dialect used in the Laserjet IIIP allows compression that\\npermits a full page 300 dpi image to be rendered with only one\\nmegabyte of memory.  An uncompressed image could be as large as\\nabout 909 Kbytes, but the printer needs about 300K of memory for\\nits internal house-keeping.  Laserjet IV models support banded\\nprinting that allows incrmental download of the image with\\ncompression in limited memory situations.  Deskjet downloadable\\nfonts are not compatible with laserjet fonts.\\n\\nA single page from a laserjet only requires about 20 seconds.  This\\nis faster than any but the most trivial printing from a deskjet\\nprinter.  The presumption, of course, being that the laser printer\\nhas completed its warm-up cyle.\\n\\nUntil ink chemistry is changed, wicking resulting in image\\ndeterioration is unavoidable.  I won't use the word impossible, but\\nmatching laser quality output from a deskjet printer is unlikely.\\nChosing an appropriate paper type helps, but does not eliminate the\\nproblem.\\n\\nLaser printers are more wastful of energy and consumable\\ncomponents.  HP does accept return of spent toner cartridges,\\nmitigating the material waste problem to a degree.  Energy waste\\ncould use more work.  Warm-up times have decreased, allowing\\nstand-by current consumption to be significantly reduced in the\\nlaserjet IV.\\n\\nKyocera produces a laser print engine that employs an amorphous\\nsilicon imaging drum with a replacable toner system.  The image\\ndrum is good for approximately 100K copies.  It is a very nice\\nprint engine.  I wish HP used the Kyocera engine.  Kyocera also has\\na neat modular paper source and stacker system.\\n\\nThe recommended duty cycle for a deskjet is significantly lower\\nthan any of HP's laser printers.  The pick-up pressure rollers are\\nsubject to wear and I case confirm eventually do wear out.  The\\nusual symptom is that the printer becomes reluctant to feed paper.\\nThe paper feed is integrated in a transport mechanism that is a\\nsingle part from HP service.  Replacement cost for the transport is\\nalmost $200.  The feed rollers are not separately replacable,\\nthough it would not be a difficult job for a competent technician.\\nI have disassembled and reassembled the transport on my own printer.\\n\\nIt depends upon the application which printer is best for you.  If\\nyou only print 5 or 10 pages a day and are satisfied with the\\nappearance of output, the deskjet is a very good choice.  As noted,\\nthe deskjet 500 is my choice for personal use.\\n\\n\",\n",

All resources of these Widgets can now be set through\\nmember-functions, while objects can be used in callback-functions. The library\\nwas made available for free or nominal cost for anonymous ftp at 129.63.1.1.\\nHowever, the library contained a large number of bugs and oversights, and only\\nworked under X11R3. Due to lack of subsequent fundings, the bindings are no\\nlonger actively supported by the University of Lowell.\\n\\nI, Ronald van Loon, at a certain point last year, have taken the Lowell \\nbindings, fixing the bugs I came across, adding missing memberfunctions, and\\nenhancing functionality and made the bug-fixed library available for the\\ngeneral public for anonymous ftp (made possible by Rick Murphy at DEC).\\n\\nNEW RELEASE\\n\\nI am now pleased to announce a new and updated release of the Motif++\\nbindings. \\n\\nThis release offers:\\n\\n- Full Motif1.1 and X11R4 support\\n- Support for Xbae widgetset \\n- Two additional widgets, written by myself, that can be used to indicate\\n  progress in an application.\\n- Imake support. NB: this release relies heavily on the existence of imake\\n\\t\\t     and its config files on your site.

They are not all Jews now.  No\\n    Jew but the most rabid bigot has ever called for an Israel to\\n    be ONLY for Jews.  That was true then.  It is true now.  \\n\\n\\nED> \"[The Palestinians are] beasts walking on two legs.\"\\nED> (Menachem Begin, Prime Minister of Israel in a speech to \\nED> the Knesset,\\nED> quoted in Amnon Kapeliouk, \\'Begin and the \"Beasts\", New \\nED> Statesman, 25 June 1982)\\n\\n    Since you inserted the words \\'The Palestinians are\\' we cannot\\n    know what Begin was talking about.  \\n    \\n    For someone who wants to embellish his own importance with an \\n    absurd pseudo-organizational name like the \\'Center for Policy\\n    Research,\\' you are not a very honest person. \\n\\n\\nED> \"Both the process of expropriation [of the Palestinians] \\nED> and the removal of the poor must be carried out \\nED> discreetly and circumspectly\".\\nED> (Dr. Theodor Herzl, The Complete Diaries, Herzl Press, \\nED> 1960, I., p.88)\\n\\n    Herzl died eighty nine years ago.  Are you suggesting that he\\n    has stated what is Israel\\'s policy today?

If you actually \\n    believe that this quote has anything to do with Israel\\'s non-\\n    Jewish citizenry today, you are an idiot.

Begin is dead.  And it\\n    should be obvious to anybody that if Israel was expansionist,\\n    it would have ANNEXED the occupied territories right after it\\n    captured them.  Israel would not be negotiating to get rid of\\n    them.\\n\\n\\nED> \"During the last 100 years our people have been in a \\nED> process of building up the country and the nation, of \\nED> expansion, of getting additional Jews and additional \\nED> settlements in order to expand the borders here.

       " ': Arrogance is arrogance.  It is not the result of religion, it is the result\\n: of people knowing or firmly believing in an idea and one\\'s desire to show\\n: others of one\\'s rightness.  I assume that God decided to be judge for our\\n: sake as much as his own, if we allow him who is kind and merciful be the \\n: judge, we\\'ll probably be better off than if others judged us or we judged \\n: ourselves.  \\n\\nI\\'m not sure I agree with this 100%.  I agree that arrogance is not the result\\nof religion and that God is a far better judge than we are.  I also agree if\\nyou mean to say that arrogance shows up in the form of trying to prove one\\'s\\nsuperior knowledge, rightness, or holiness over another person\\'s beliefs.\\n\\nI need to be careful to understand what you mean here so that I do not fall\\ninto the mistake of misrepresenting your views.  If I fall down in this area\\nI hope you will forgive me.\\n\\nArrogance is not the result of believing one is right or of believing that\\none\\'s God is greater than the god\\'s of others or of believing that one\\'s\\nreligion is better than other religions.  These are all naturally self-implied\\nbeliefs.\\n\\nIt is self-contradictory to say that I believe my current beliefs to be wrong.\\nWere I to find myself in error, my beliefs would naturally change and follow\\nwhat I believe to be right.  Therefore, I must always consider my beliefs\\ncorrect.  That\\'s not arrogance.  That\\'s unavoidable behavior.\\n\\nIt is nonsense to say that I believe another person\\'s god to be greater than\\nmy God.  Were his or her god greater, wouldn\\'t I be obligated to change so\\nthat their god would become my God?  We are naturally obligated to worship\\nthat God which we deem to be the greatest.  Why should we feel obligated to\\nworship a second best god for the sake of feeling humble?\\n\\nArrogance is not necessarily thinking onesself to be better looking or more\\nintelligent or stronger or having more resources than another person.  No\\ndoubt many will have to chew on this one awhile.  Were passive observation\\nof one\\'s superior points arrogance, then God would be most arrogant of all.\\n\\nHumility does not rest in slandering or belittling God\\'s work of creation in\\nour lives.  People often go around trying to be humble saying to one another,\\n\"I\\'m not very smart.  I\\'m poor.  I\\'m not good looking.  I\\'m just a worm in\\nthe ground.  I\\'m such a weak person and although I don\\'t want to sin, I\\nreally cannot help it.\"  Were this person truely humble, he would take a\\ndifferent approach.  \"God, thank you for making me the way you did.  I know\\nthat you never do anything second best.  Yet with all that you have given me,\\nI have been so unthankful.  You\\'ve given me power to resist the devil.  I\\nhave not used it but have indulged myself in doing exactly what you have said\\nnot to do.  I have slandered your creation in my life and have credited myself\\nwith humility for doing so.  Lord, with all you\\'ve given me, I have been\\ncompletely unfaithful and I do not deserve your forgiveness.  And, yet Your\\nlove for me is so boundless that you would give Yourself to die for me to\\nsave me.  As terribly evil as I am, I deserve to go straight to hell, yet it\\npleases you somehow to rescue me from this terrible life I\\'ve led.  Lord,\\nplease forgive me and help me stay on the right track so that I can bring\\nglory to Your Name instead of insult.  Lord I\\'m so sorry for my wrongs.  Please\\nhelp me to change.\"\\n\\n: \\n: I think people take exceptional offense to religious arrogance because\\n: they don\\'t want to be wrong.  If I find someone arrogant, I typically\\n: don\\'t have anything to do with them.\\n\\nFor me, I\\'ve often found it hard to tell the difference.  Often times, the\\nmost humble christian has come across to me as arrogant while the most\\nproud \"worm in the ground\" false humility type person has been found to be\\nmost comfortable company.\\n\\nWhen I\\'m wrong and arrogant about my wrongness, I certainly don\\'t feel like\\nbeing confronted by my wrongness.  Were someone to confront me verbally with\\nmy wrongness, I\\'d be likely to snap at them and examine them head to toe for\\nall their faults and charge them with hypocricy for what they said to me.\\nAt the root, my desire would be to make them shut up so that I can go about\\nliving my life arrogantly as I wish.  However, were someone to confront me\\nsilently by their example, earn my respect, and perhaps mention it to me in\\nhumility in private, I\\'d feel broken down and challenged to seek God for help\\nin changing from the error of my ways.\\n\\nThe hard part is getting to the point to where I can be humble before anyone\\nregardless of their humility or pride--regardless of their hypocricy or\\nsincerity--regardless of whether onlookers will frown down upon me or not.\\nIt isn\\'t easy to take this pain in love with thankfulness for the opportunity\\nto improve in one\\'s ability to serve God.  It\\'s easier to cast aside any hope\\nof reaching true humility and merely hide behind slandering God\\'s creation\\nin our lives instead.\\n\\n: But we should examine ourselves [I hope I typed this back in right]\\n: and why we react to certain situations with such emotions.  For instance,\\n: many of us feel \"justified\" to be insulted by an arrogant person.  As if\\n: we needed a reason to feel insulted.  But after being insulted over and\\n: over again by the words of others, you\\'d think we\\'d either toughen up\\n: or decide not to be insulted, or ignore the insult.  Just because you\\n: can justify feelings of anger or insult or outrage, that doesn\\'t make that\\n: reaction the appropriate one.  It is in this light of self-examination\\n: that we can change our emotional reactions.\\n: \\n\\nSometimes it helps when we can understand and feel the difference between\\nwhat is a true statement of our character and what is a false and slanderous\\nstatement of our character.  The devil is the accuser of the bretheren.  He\\nwould love us to feel hopelessly guilty where we are innocent and feel arrogant\\nand self-righteous where we are indeed wrong.  The devil\\'s aim is to get us\\ninto as much misery as he can.  Just think of the devil as a cruel and merci-\\nless criminal who torments a parent by burning his or her children with\\nhot irons.  The way the devil gets under the Father\\'s skin is by hurting\\nthose that the Father loves so much.\\n\\n\\n--\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\t\"I deplore the horrible crime of child murder...\\n\\t We want prevention, not merely punishment.\\n\\t We must reach the root of the evil...\\n\\t It is practiced by those whose inmost souls revolt\\n\\t from the dreadful deed...\\n\\t No mater what the motive, love of ease,\\n\\t\\tor a desire to save from suffering the unborn innocent,\\n\\t\\tthe woman is awfully guilty who commits the deed...\\n\\t but oh! thrice guilty is he who drove her\\n\\t\\tto the desperation which impelled her to the crime.\"',\n",

       " 'This might be better directed to s.r.c.bible-study, which I have begun\\nreading, but since my earlier notes were posted to this forum, I will\\nconclude here as well.  A week ago, I managed to find time to consult\\na Septuagint Concordance and a LXX text with apparatus at the library,\\nand I can now usefully conclude my look at the Greek words for love as\\nused in the Christian background of the Septuagintal translation of the\\nJewish scriptures.\\n\\nThe principal result is that there is a cluster of uses of the verbal\\nnoun from _erao:_, _eraste:s_ meaning \"lover.\"  This cluster occurs just\\nwhere one might most expect it, in the propethic image (and accusation)\\nof Israel as faithless spouse to YHWH.  The verses in question are Hosea\\n2:5,7 & 10; Jeremiah 4:30, 22:20 & 22; Lamentations 1:19; and Ezekiel\\n16:33, 36 &37 and 23:5, 9 & 22.\\n\\n\\t[ Hosea seems to have originated this usage, which Jeremiah and\\n\\t  Ezekiel picked up;  Lamentations is dependent on, though not\\n\\t  likely written by, Jeremiah. ]\\n\\nThe \"erotic\" meaning (in its allegorical use, not at all literally) is\\nevident.  So too in English, unless you complement it with a phrase like\\n\"of the arts\" the word \"lover\" is going to have an overtone of sexual\\nrelationship.  There is no surprise here, but it is worthwhile to see\\nthat standard Greek usage *does* show up in the translations from the\\nHebrew! :-)\\n\\nMore interestingly, and some confirmation of my guess that later Koine\\nusage avoided the verb _erao:_ because of its homonymy to _ero:_ (say),\\n_eromai_ (ask), there is an error in Codex Vaticanus (normally, a very\\nvaluable witness) where a form of _erao:_ is used in a completely absurd\\ncontext -- 2 Samuel 20:18, where the  meaning *must* be \"say.\"\\n\\nIn addition to the above (and the uses I have already mentioned in Proverbs),\\nEsther 2:17 uses the verb in its most natural application, \\n\\n\\tkai e:rasthe\" ho basileus Esthe:r  --  and the King loved Esther\\n\\nand, rather more interestingly, 1 Samuel 19:2 supplies a modest degree of\\nsupport to the gay appraisal of the relationship of David and Jonathan:\\n\\n\\tkai Io:nathan huios Saoul e:[i]reito ton Dauid sphodra\\n\\t-- and Jonathan, Saul\\'s son, loved David intensely\\n\\n\\t[ I\\'m using the bracketed [i] for io:ta subscript, which I\\n\\t  don\\'t yet have a reasonable ASCII convention for. ]\\n\\n(The relevance of this to the gay issue is not anything implicit about\\nthe \"historical\" facts, but just that a quasi-official translation of\\nthe Hebrew text in the Hellenistic period makes no bones about using the\\n\"erotic\" verb in this context.  Given the quite general usage of _agapao:_\\nfor erotic senses, this need not mean anything \"more\" than _agapao:_ alone\\nwould mean, but it DOES disambiguate the relationship, as far as this\\ntranslator goes!)',\n",

Was\\nDS>that the one with the little illuminated Dragon\\'s Head on the front\\nDS>fender, a style later copied by Indian, and the round side covers?\\n\\nNo. Not at all. The Viking was a trick little unit made way back when\\n(forties? fifties?) when Spag was trying to make a go of it in racing.\\nThe first iteration (the Springer) was a boxer twin, very similar to Max\\nFriz\\'s famous design, but with an overhead \"point cam\" (see below for\\nmore on the valvetrain). The problem was that the thing had no ground\\nclearance whatsoever. The solution was to curve the cylinder bores, so\\nthat the ground clearance was substantially increased:\\n\\n\\n      ==@==   <-Springer motor (front)\\n                 Viking motor (front) ->   \\\\=@=/\\n\\nThis is roughly the idea, except that the bores were gradually curved\\naround a radius, as the pistons were loath to make a sharp-angled turn\\nin the middle of their stroke. The engine also had curved connecting\\nrods to accomodate the stroke.\\n\\nThe engine stuck out so far because of its revolutionary (and still\\nunique) overhead cam system. Through the use of clever valve timing and\\nand extrordinarily trick valve linkage, only a single cam lobe was\\nrequired to drive both overhead valves.\\n\\nJust as revolutionary was the hydraulic valve actuation, which used a\\npressurized stream of oil to power the \"waterwheel\" which kept the lobe\\nspinning over. One side effect that required some rather brutal\\nengineering fixes was that until the engine\\'s oil pressure came up to\\nnormal, the engine\\'s valve timing would be more or less random,\\nresulting in some impressive start-up valve damage. The solution was a\\nlittle hand crank that pressurized the cases before you started the\\nbeast, remarkably similar to the system used in new Porsches to\\npressurize the oil system before the car is started (the cage, however,\\nuses an electric oil pump. Wimps).\\n\\nDespite this fix, the engine had a nasty propensity for explosively\\nfiring its valves into the pistons when a cylinder would temporarily\\nlose a bit of oil pressure in a corner. The solution was to run even\\nhigher oil pressures and change the gaskets and seals regularly. This\\nwas feasible because it was a racing engine.\\n\\nWith just a single overhead lobe, and no pushrod/shaft/chain towers\\nbecause of the hydraulic system, the head of the engine came to an\\nalmost perfect point:\\n\\n                    /\\\\\\n                   /()\\\\   <-lobe\\n                  / XX \\\\  <-complex linkage (not shown due to\\n valvestems ->   / \\\\  / \\\\    complexity)\\n                |  |   | |\\n                |  |===| |\\n                    =0=  <---piston\\n                     |\\n                             Note that the tip was not truly vertical\\n                             (it was at about a 70 degree angle to the\\n                             ground, and this drawing doesn\\'t show the\\n                             curvature because there was none in the\\n                             head itself.

Thus, the\\nname.\\n\\nThe Vik was a moderately successful racer, lightning fast when it\\nworked, but plagued by problems relating to its revolutionary\\ntechnology. Eventually, it was dumped when Spag finally realized that\\nracing was not where the Spagthorpe name would be made.

The 27th was a short day at\\nwork, we worked until eleven or eleven-thirty and left for home. I decided\\nto go for a short walk. I went to Primorsky Park. I walked past the Eternal\\nFlame and saw a group of about 8 to 10 people standing there. When I had\\nwalked another 15 to 20 yards I heard the screech of automobile brakes\\nbehind me. I turned my head toward the sound. It was a light blue GAZ-24\\nVolga. I see that the people who were standing there have gone over to the \\ncar. A man and a woman get out. The man is expensively dressed, in a suit,\\nand the woman has a raincoat on. She doesn\\'t have anything on her head, and \\nher hair is let down, sightly reddish hair, a heavy-set woman. They\\'re 40 to \\n45 years old. They get something out of the trunk. The people start to help\\nthem. I become curious just what are they pulling out of there?\\n\\nWhen I got up close I heard them turn something on. I didn\\'t see what it was, \\nbut it was probably a tape recorder. They put it on the ground near the \\nEternal Flame honoring the 26 Baku Commissars and formed a tight circle\\naround it. I ask, \"What\\'s going on?\" Someone tells me, \"Come listen.\" Well\\nthey were Azerbaijanis, I had asked in Azerbaijani. I hear appeals: \"Brother\\nMuslims, our time has come . . . \" and something else along that line. I\\ndidn\\'t understand what it was all about. I walked around the group trying to \\nget a look at the owner of the tape recorder. But the circle drew in tighter. \\nNew people started coming from various directions, five here, seven there. And\\nthe comments started: \"Right, we should slaughter the Armenians!\" and \"There\\'s\\nno need to be afraid, all of Moscow is behind us.\" I even heard that: \"All \\nMoscow is behind us.\" Well I watched and listened in and realized that this \\nwas no joke. I quietly left and went home.\\n\\nNow before that at work I had heard that something was going on in Karabagh, \\nthat there were demonstrations there. Well, people were saying all kinds of \\nthings, but I didn\\'t have any idea what was really going on.\\n\\nMy wife and son were at home, but my daughter was at my aunt\\'s house in Baku. \\nI didn\\'t say anything to my wife. We sat and drank tea. Sometime around two\\no\\'clock right behind our house suddenly there is noise, whistling, and \\nshouting. I looked out the window and saw a crowd. The crowd is moving slowly,\\nlike they show on TV when blacks in South Africa are striking or having a \\ndemonstration and move slowly.\\n\\nMy wife asks what\\'s going on out there. I say I don\\'t know. I put on some\\noutdoor clothes and went out to find out what it was all about. In the crowd\\npeople are shouting \"Down with the Armenians!\" and \"Death to the Armenians!\" I\\nwaited for the entire crowd to pass. At first they went down Narimanov Street \\non the side with the SK club and the City Party Committee; then they turned \\nand went against the traffic--it\\'s one way there--down the Street of the 26 \\nBaku Commissars toward the streetcar line. I went home and told my wife there \\nwas a demonstration going on. In fact I thought that we were having the same \\nkind of demonstrations that they had had in Yerevan and in Karabagh. Aside \\nfrom the things they were shouting, I was surprised that there were only young\\npeople in the crowd. And they were minors, under draft age.\\n\\nMy wife and son wanted to go upstairs to visit a friend, but I was kind of\\nuneasy and said, \"No, let\\'s stay at home instead.\" An hour went by, or maybe \\nan hour and a half. Well, I wasn\\'t keeping track of the time, I can\\'t say\\nexactly how long it was. I look and see another crowd on Narimanov, but now on\\nthe side with the microdistricts, the bazaar, and the Rossiya movie theater.\\n\\nI put outside clothes on and went out again. There\\'s noise, an uproar outside,\\nand the crowd has grown. There are more people. And whereas the first time \\nthere were individual shouts, this time they are more focused, more \\naggressive. No, I think, something\\'s wrong here, this isn\\'t any demonstration.\\nThey would run, stop, then walk quickly and make sharp dashes, and then run \\nagain. I was walking along the sidewalk and they were in the street. I \\nfollowed them. I was thinking I\\'d just watch and see. Who knew where this was \\nleading? We came out on Lenin Square. At the square the SK club is on one \\nside, and the City Party Committee is on the other. I went toward the square \\nand heard noise and shouting, as though the whole town had turned out. There \\nwas some sort of a rally going on. I go closer and hear exclamations, appeals.\\nI heard both anti-Armenian and anti-Soviet appeals. \"We don\\'t need \\nperestroika, we want to go on living like we have been.\" Now what did they \\nmean by \"living like we have been?\" The Azerbaijanis work like everyone else. \\nBut too many people live at the expense of the government and at the expense \\nof others. Speculation, theft, and cheating go on all the time. And not just \\nin Azerbaijan, everywhere, in all the republics, but I\\'ve never seen it \\nanywhere else like I have in Azerbaijan.\\n\\nNow at this rally someone says that they should go around to the Armenians\\' \\napartments and drive them out, beat them and drive them out. True, I didn\\'t \\nhear them say \"kill them\" over the microphone, I only heard \"beat them and \\ndrive them out.\" I stayed at the square a few minutes longer. First one, then\\nanother are going up onto the stage, and no one tries to stop the crowd. Off\\nto the side of the crowd there were small groups of three or four people, and \\nI think they were MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] or State Security KGB.\\nThere were also uniformed policemen there, but I didn\\'t see any of them try \\nto pacify the crowd. New people kept coming up onto the stage.\\n\\nWell I had finally decided that this could end badly: This was no\\ndemonstration, and I had to protect my family.\\n\\nI left the Square to return home and suddenly noticed a truck. It was next\\nto the City Party Committee, on Narimanov Street, it stood next to the tai-\\nlor\\'s shop there, a low truck, and it had low, wooden panels. I see that some-\\nthing is being unloaded, crates of some sort. I decided to go look because\\nafter all those appeals I was apprehensive and thought there might be weapons\\nin there. They pulled the crates out onto the square, not toward the City \\nParty Committee, but toward the SK club. And when I went right up to them I \\nsaw that they were cases of vodka. There were two people handing down the \\ncases from the bed of the truck, and on the ground there were many people, 15 \\nto 20. They were handing them down from the truck and each case was carried \\noff by two people. Two people, one case of vodka. And there was a man standing\\nright next to the truck and he was handing out roundish black lumps, maybe \\nabout the size of a fist, maybe a little bigger or smaller. It was anasha. \\nWhen I passed next to that person, he stood with his side to me. There was \\nabout a yard and a half between us, and two people were standing near him. He \\nhas a package in his hand, and he\\'s pulling out anasha and handing it out. I \\nhave never smoked it myself. Once I tried it for fun, but I\\'ve seen a lot of \\npeople smoke it, I\\'ve seen it many times, and I know what it is. I strolled \\naround and no one asked me who I was or what I was doing there.\\n\\nBefore I got to the Glass Bazaar I heard more howling, more warlike shouting. \\nI turned around and saw them running. Well I\\'ll just keep on going like I am, \\nI thought. When they caught up with me I saw that they were carrying flags. \\nAnd I recognized the person who was carrying the flag on my side of the \\nstreet. He\\'s a young guy, 21 or 22 years old. He was carrying a red flag, \\nwhich had \"Ermeni oryum\" written on it in Azerbaijani, that means \"Death to \\nArmenians!\" That guy used to live off the same courtyard as us. I don\\'t really\\nknow what his name is, but I know his father very well. His father\\'s name is\\nRafik; he used to be a cook, and then became head chef. He used to have a dark\\nblue Zhiguli van, then he sold it and now he has a white Zhiguli 06. His \\nfamily, as I said, lived on the same courtyard as we did. Our building was on \\nNarimanov Street, and theirs was on the Street of the 26 Baku Commissars; \\ntheir apartment was in the far entryway, on the fifth floor, the door on the \\nleft. Now Rafik\\'s little brother lives there, and he, Rafik, I heard, got a \\nnew apartment either in the forth or eighth microdistrict. In a word, his son \\nwas carrying a flag that said \"Death to Armenians!\" I was surprised because \\nbefore this I had gotten the impression that all of this nonsense was being \\ndone not by people from Sumgait, but by Azerbaijanis from Agdam and Kafan.\\n\\nWell anyway I went home. My wife was upset. I told her, \"It\\'s OK, it\\'ll pass, \\nthey\\'re young kids, they\\'ve just gotten all whooped up.\" Naturally I didn\\'t \\nwant her to get overly upset. After a while a new surge of crowd went by. And \\nthis time they were breaking glass. I could hear it breaking, but I couldn\\'t \\nsee where. Well I think, here we go, the machine\\'s in motion. They weren\\'t \\nhanding out that vodka and anasha for nothing. I didn\\'t see people drinking \\nand smoking on the spot, but they certainly hadn\\'t unloaded the vodka and \\nhashish to put in a store window!\\n\\nSo the thought flashed through my head that the machine was running, no one \\nwould stop them now, they weren\\'t even trying, although, I\\'ll say it again, \\nthe police were there, I saw them. And it\\'s not just that the police weren\\'t \\nbreaking them up, they were joking with them, they were having a good time. \\nTrue, at the time I couldn\\'t even imagine that under our government, our much-\\nvaunted leadership--and I\\'m not afraid to say these words: so many people \\ndied, So many women were abused, and how many abominations there were!--I \\ncouldn\\'t imagine that under our much-vaunted authorities, and if I were to be \\nspecific, I would say under the much-touted authorities in our city of \\nSumgait, I couldn\\'t imagine that such things could take place.\\n\\nWhen they started breaking glass I told my wife and son: \"Let\\'s go upstairs.\" \\nWe went to our neighbors, the Grigorians, on the fourth floor. And in the \\nevening, when those crowds started going past again, I went outside once more.\\nI stopped at \"The Corner,\" a place called that right next to the bazaar. I \\nlook and see a crowd on the run. And there, a few yards from the entrance to \\nthe bazaar, are three respectable-looking men of around, say, 50 years old. \\nThe crowd was running and one of the three waved with his arm and pointed \\ntoward the bazaar. And then the whole crowd, as though it were one person, \\nwheeled and raced toward the bazaar. And not a soul went past those three, as \\nthough it were off limits! Well everything got all churned up, there was more \\nnoise, and the glass was flying again.\\n\\nWe spent the night at the neighbors\\'. My apartment was on the first floor,\\nthere was really no way to defend yourself there.\\n\\nIn the morning I went out to buy bread and to see what was happening in town. \\nOn the way I saw someone hunched up, still. I never found out who it was or \\nwhat happened to him. There were 10 to 15 people standing near him. I got the \\nbread and on my way back, they had gathered around the person who was lying \\nthere hunched up, sort of enclosing him; because of the way they were standing\\nyou couldn\\'t even see him.\\n\\nThat was on the morning of February 28.

       " '\\nThis is quite a misrepresentation.  After WWI, many Bosnian Muslims were\\nkilled and their land taken over by Serbs, and the motive was plunder,\\nnot some fictitious \"supression of rebellion.\"  Even earlier, one can\\npoint to the destruction of mosques in Serbia itself and expulsion of\\nMuslims.  Here is what Dr. Vaso Cubrilovic, political adviser to the\\nSerbian monarchic regime, says in his memorandum \"The Expulsion of the\\nArnauts\" which he presented to the royal government of Stojadinovic\\non March 7, 1937, in Belgrade:\\n\\n   The Mode of Removal\\n   -------------------\\n\\n   [ describes how expulsion of ethnic Albanians from Kosova is to proceed\\n   through state terror and \"private initiative\", i.e. Chetnik plunder: ]\\n\\n   Private initiative, too, can assist greatly in this direction.  We should\\n   distribute weapons to our colonists, as need be.  The old forms of Chetnik\\n   action should be organized and secretly assisted.  [...]\\n   ...the whole affair should be presented as a conflict between clans and,\\n   if need be, ascribed to economic reasons.  Finally, local riots can be\\n   incited.  These will be bloodily suppressed with the clans and the\\n   Chetniks, rather than the army.\\n\\n   There remains one more means, WHICH SERBIA EMPLOYED WITH GREAT PRACTICAL\\n   EFFECT AFTER 1878, that is, by secretly burning down Albanian villages\\n   and city quarters.\\n\\n(Emphasis above is mine.)  These events in Serbia itself forced out virtually\\nall Muslims during late 19th century.  This policy of state terrorism\\nagainst Muslims, aided by Chetnik \"private initiative,\" has continued in WWII\\nand today.  For example, Muhamed Hadzijahic in his book \"Od tradicije do \\nidentiteta: Geneza nacionalnog pitanja bosanskih Muslimana\" (Sarajevo:\\nSvjetlost, 1974) writes (pg. 235) how Serbs killed a Muslim in Foca\\nin WWII even though he claimed to be a Serbian patriot, explaining\\ntheir action as follows:\\n\\n   \"Inasmuch as you were a Serb, you sullied the Serb name, because you\\n   are a Turk [i.e. Muslim].  And since you helped us, we shall not\\n   torture you.\"\\n\\nso the shot him instead of cutting his throat.  In the past year, Serbs\\nhave repeated the slaughter of Muslim residents of Foca.  Destruction\\nof mosques, including priceless historical monuments, completes the\\neradication of the Muslim presence from territories claimed by Serbs.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhich part do you claim is untrue?  Explain yourself, or withdraw your claim.\\n\\n\\nCroatia never had many Muslim citizens for historical reasons, because it\\nwas not a part of the Ottoman Empire.  The last major battles between\\nAustro-Hungarian monarchy and the Ottoman Empire in Croatia were at the\\nend of the 17th century.  Need I remind you that modern Croatian nationalism\\ncame into being with Dr. Ante Starcevic, who saw Bosnian Muslims as the\\nbest Croats, so much so that in 1853 he contemplated moving his operations \\nto Sarajevo?  You are confusing clericalist Croatianism with Croatian\\nnationalism here.   Political nationalism has always been stronger.  As\\nfor your other theories, you are clearly overjoyed that Croat-Muslim\\nalliance in Bosnia-Herzegovina is now in trouble.  Arguments such as\\nyours are clearly intended to create and deepen this split.  \\n\\n\\nIn international relations 101 you\\'ll learn that unless weak unite to\\ncounterbalance the strong player, soon they are taken over and that\\'s the\\nend of them.  Balance of power thinking has brought together Croats\\nand Bosnian Muslims.  This is only natural; all other alignments are\\nunstable.  I\\'m working on pointing out this basic fact: Croats and\\nMuslims have been aware of it for as long as Serbia has existed.  \\nYou are wrong if you think only \"image\" is at stake here.  Croatia has\\na deep interest in her alliance with Bosnian Muslims, and vice versa.  \\n\\nI think Tudjman understands this, although he does not have much choice \\nat this point.  Tensions should have been defused better earlier, before \\nany open confrontation developed.  Although I still think Croatia will\\nsurvive, it will lose a lot; but Bosnian Muslims may end up even worse\\noff.  However, their position now is so horrible that perhaps they do not\\nsee it getting any worse.  The key point is: do they still have any hope left?\\nIf not, then all bets are off.\\n\\nMr. Stojanovic is clearly very, very happy about this.  I\\'m deeply hurt.\\nThis is not about some \"image\" but about survival of a concept of a\\npartnership which I believe is natural and essential for both Croats\\nand Muslims.  ',\n",

Tgif is another MacDraw like tool that can handle X11 bitmap (xbm)\\n  and X11 pixmap (xpm) formats.  If the image you have is in formats\\n  other than xbm or xpm, you can get the pbmplus toolkit to convert\\n  things like gif or even some Macintosh formats to xpm.\\n  Tgif\\'s sources are available in the pub directory on cs.ucla.edu\\n  (Version 2.12 of tgif at patchlevel 7 plus patch8 and patch9)\\n\\nd. Use the editimage facility of KHOROS (see below).\\n  This is just one utility in the overall system- you can essentially do all\\n  your image processing and macdraw-type graphics using this package.\\n\\ne. You might be able to get by with PBMPlus.  pbmtext gives you text output\\n  bitmaps which can be overlaid on top of your image.\\n\\nf. \\'ice\\' requires Sun hardware running OpenWindows 3.It\\'s a PostScript-based\\n  graphical editor,and it\\'s available for anonymous ftp from Internet host\\n  eo.soest.hawaii.edu (128.171.151.12).

This was\\n  developed at the University of Colorado (Boulder) by some people working\\n  for Alex Goetz.  You might try contacting them if you already have IDL\\n  or would be willing to buy it.  It\\'s a few thousand dollars (American) I\\n  expect for IDL and the other should be free.  Those are the general\\n  purpose packages I\\'ve heard of, besides what TerraMar has.\\n  SIPS _was_ written for AVIRIS imagery.  I\\'m not sure how general purpose\\n  it is.  You would have to contact Goetz or one of his people and ask.  I\\n  have another piece of software (PCW) that does PC and Walsh\\n  transformations with pseudocoloring and clustering and limited image\\n  modification (you can compute an image using selected components).  I\\'ve\\n  used it on 70 megabyte AVIRIS images without problems, but for the best\\n  speed you need an external DSP card.  It will work without it, but large\\n  images take quite a while (50-70 times as long) to process.  That\\'s a\\n  freebie if you want it\"\\n\\n  \"My  favorite is IDL (Interactive Data Language) from Research Systems,\\n  Inc.  IDL is in my opinion, much better and infinitely easier. Its\\n  programming language is very strong and easy -- very Pascal-like. It\\n  handles the number-crunching very well, also. Personally, I like doing\\n  the number-crunching with IDL on the VAX (or Mathematica, Igor, or even\\n  Excel on the Mac if it\\'s not too hairy), then bringing it over to NIH\\n  Image for the imaging part. I have yet to encounter any situation which\\n  that combination couldn\\'t handle, and the speed and ease of use\\n  (compared to IRAF) was incredible. By the way, it\\'s mostly astronomical\\n  image processing which I\\'ve been doing. This means image enhancement,\\n  cleaning up bad lines/pixels, and some other traditional image\\n  processing routines. Then, for example, taking a graph of intensity\\n  versus position along a line I choose with the mouse, then doing a curve\\n  fit to that line (which I might do like in KaleidaGraph.) \"\\n\\n[ For IDL call Research Systems , for PV-WAVE call Precision Visuals and\\n for SIPS call University of Colorado @ Boulder .

GIS (Geographical Information Systems software)\\n===================================================\\n\\nGRASS\\n-----\\n  (Geographic Resource Analysis Support System) of the US Army\\n  Construction Engineering Research Lab (CERL). It is a popular geographic and\\n  remote sensing image processing package. Many may think of GRASS as a\\n  Geographic Information System rather than an Image Processing package,\\n  although it is reported to have significant image processing\\n  capabilities.\\n\\n  Feature Descriptions\\n\\n  I use GRASS  because it\\'s public domain and can be obtained through the\\n  internet for free.  GRASS runs in Unix and is written in C.  The source\\n  code can be obtained through an anonymous ftp from the Office of Grass\\n  Integration.  You then compile the source code for your machine, using\\n  scripts provided with GRASS.  I would recommend GRASS for someone who\\n  already has a workstation and is on a limited budget. GRASS is not very\\n  user-friendly, compared to Macintosh software.\" A first review  of\\n  overview documentation indicates that it looks useful and has some pixel\\n  resampling functions not in other packages plus good general purpose\\n  image enhancement routines (fft). Kelly Maurice at Vexcel Corp. in\\n  Boulder, CO is a primary user of GRASS .  This gentleman has used the\\n  GRASS software and developed multi-spectral (238 bands ??) volumetric\\n  rendering, full color, on Suns and Stardents. It was a really effective\\n  interface.  Vexcel Corp. currently has a contract to map part of Venus\\n  and convert the Magellan radar data into contour maps.

GRASS  is public-domain, and can run on a high-end PC\\n  under UNIX. It is raster-based, has some image-processing capability,\\n  and can display vector data (but analysis must be done in the raster\\n  environment). I have used GRASS V.3 on a SUN workstation and found it\\n  easy to use. It is best, of course, for data that are well represented\\n  in raster (grid-cell) form.\\n\\n  Availability\\n\\n  CERL\\'s Office of Grass Integration (OGI)  maintains an ftp server:\\n  moon.cecer.army.mil (129.229.20.254).\\n\\n  Mail regarding this site should be addressed to\\n  grass-ftp-admin@moon.cecer.army.mil.\\n\\n  This location will be the new \"canonical\" source for GRASS software, as\\n  well as bug fixes, contributed sources, documentation, and other files.\\n  This FTP server also supports dynamic compression and uncompression and\\n  \"tar\" archiving of files.

Microstation is a base  graphics package that Imager\\n  sits on top of. Imager is basically an  image processing package with a\\n  heavy GIS/remote sensing flavor.\\n\\n  Feature Description\\n\\n  Basic geometry manipulations: flip, mirror, rotate, generalized affine.\\n  Rectification: Affine, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th order models as well as a\\n  projective model (warp an image to a vector map or to another image).\\n  RGB to IHS and IHS to RGB conversion.

Complex Histogram/Contrast control.  Layer Controller: manages\\n  up to 64 images at a time -- user can extract single bands from a 3 band\\n  image or create color images by combining various individual bands, etc.\\n\\n  The package is designed for a remote sensing application (it can handle\\n  VERY LARGE images) and there is all kinds of other software available\\n  for GIS applications.\\n  Host Configuration Requirements\\n\\n  It runs on Intergraph Workstations (a Unix machine similar to a Sun)\\n  though there  were rumors (there are always rumors) that the software\\n  would be  ported to PC and possibly a Sun environment.\\n\\nPCI\\n---\\n  A company called PCI, Inc., out of Richmond Hill, Ontario, Canada, makes\\n  an array of software utilities for processing, manipulation, and use of\\n  remote sensing data in eight or ten different \"industry standard\"\\n  formats: LGSOWG, BSQ, LANDSAT, and a couple of others whose titles I\\n  forget.  The software is available in versions for MS-DOS, Unix\\n  workstations (among them HP, Sun, and IBM), and VMS, and quite possibly\\n  other platforms by now.  I use the VMS version.\\n\\n  The \"PCI software\" consists of several classes/groups/packages of\\n  utilities, grouped by function but all operating on a common \"PCI\\n  database\" disk file.  The \"Tape I/O\" package is a set of utility\\n  programs which read from the various remote-sensing industry tape\\n  formats INTO, or write those formats out FROM, the \"PCI database\" file;\\n  this is the only package I use or know much about.  Other packages can\\n  display data from the PCI database to one or another of several\\n  PCI-supported third-party color displays, output numeric or bitmap\\n  representation of image data to an attached printer, e.g. an Epson-type\\n  dot-matrix graphics printer.  You might be more spe- cifically\\n  interested in the mathematical operations package: histo- gram and\\n  Fourier analysis, equalization, user-specified operations (e.g.\\n  \"multiply channel 1 by 3, add channel 2, and store as channel 5\"), and\\n  God only knows what all else -- there\\'s a LOT.  I don\\'t have and don\\'t\\n  use these, so can\\'t say much about them; you only buy the packages your\\n  particular application/interest calls for.\\n\\n  Each utility is controlled by from one to eight \"parameters,\" read from\\n  a common \"parameter file\" which must be (in VMS anyway) in your \"default\\n  directory.\"  Some utilities will share parameters and use the same\\n  parameter for a different purpose, so it can get a bit confusing setting\\n  up a series of operations.  The standard PCI environment contains a\\n  scripting language very similar to IBM-PC BASIC, but which allows you to\\n  automate the process of setting up parameters for a common, complicated,\\n  lengthy or difficult series of utility executions.  (In VMS I can also\\n  invoke utilities independently from a DCL command procedure.)  There\\'s\\n  also an optional programming library which allows you to write compiled\\n  language programs which can interface with (read from/write to) the PCI\\n  data structures (database file, parameter file).\\n\\n  The PCI software is designed specifically for remote-sensing images, but\\n  requires such a level of operator expertise that, once you reach the\\n  level where you can handle r-s images, you can figure out ways to handle\\n  a few other things as well.  For instance, the Tape I/O package offers a\\n  utility for reading headerless multi-band (what Adobe PhotoShop on the\\n  Macintosh calls \"raw\") data from tape, in a number of different\\n  \"interleave\" orders. This turns out to be ideal for manipulating the\\n  graphic-arts industry\\'s \"CT2T\" format, would probably (I haven\\'t tried)\\n  handle Targa, and so on. Above all, however, you HAVE TO KNOW WHAT\\n  YOU\\'RE DOING or you can screw up to the Nth degree and have to start\\n  over.  It\\'s worth noting that the PCI \"database\" file is designed to\\n  contain not only \"raster\" (image) data, but vectors (for overlaying map\\n  information entered via digitizing table), land-use, and all manner of\\n  other information (I observe that a remote-sensing image tape often\\n  contains all manner of information about the spectral bands, latitude,\\n  longitude, time, date, etc. of the original satellite pass; all of this\\n  can go into the PCI \"database\").\\n\\n  I _believe_ that on workstations the built-in display is used.  On VAX\\n  systems OTHER than workstations PCI supports only a couple of specific\\n  third-party display systems (the name Gould/Deanza seems to come to\\n  mind).  One of MY personal workarounds was a display program which would\\n  display directly from a PCI \"database\" file to a Peritek VCT-Q (Q-bus\\n  24-bit DirectColor) display subsystem.  PCI software COULD be \"overkill\"\\n  in your case; it seems designed for the very \"high end\"\\n  applications/users, i.e. those for whom a Mac/PC largely doesn\\'t suffice\\n  (although as you know the gap is getting smaller all the time).

That was designed\\n  for Airborne Imaging Spectrometer imagery (byte data, <= 256 pixels\\n  across by <= 512 lines by <= 256 bands); a modified version has since\\n  been developed for AVIRIS (Airborne VIsual and InfraRed Imaging\\n  Spectrometer) which uses much larger images.\\n\\n  Spam does none of these things (rectification, classification, PC and\\n  IHS transformations, filtering, contrast enhancement, overlays).\\n  Actually, it does limited filtering and contrast enhancement\\n  (stretching).  Spam is aimed at spectral identification and clustering.\\n\\n  The original Spam uses X or SunView to display.  The AVIRIS version may\\n  require VICAR, an executive based on TAE, and may also require a frame\\n  buffer.  I can refer you to people if you\\'re interested.  PCW requires X\\n  for display.\\n\\nMAP II\\n------\\n  Among the Mac GIS systems, MAP II is distributed by John Wiley.\\n\\nCLRview\\n-------\\n  CLRview is a 3-dimensional visualization program designed to exploit\\n  the real-time capabilities of Silicon Graphics IRIS computers.\\n\\n  This program is designed to provide a core set of tools to aid in the\\n  visualization of information from CAD and GIS sources.

If we got some kind of mouth disease\\nfor lying, would any of us have mouths left?  What if we developed\\nblindness every time we lusted after someone or something?

If AIDS, or any\\nother STD is a *punishment\" for sexual sin, what do we do with \\ndiseases like cancer, or multiple sclerosis, which are just as\\ndebilitating and terrible as AIDS, yet are not usually linked to a\\nspecific behavior or lifestyle?\\n\\nAtonement is *extremely* important, but I think you\\'ve missed the mark\\nabout as far as you can by suggesting that AIDS is an atonement for sin.\\nThe atonement for sin is JESUS CHRIST - period.  This is the central\\nmessage of the Gospel.  A perfect sacrifice was required for our sins,\\nand was made in the Lamb of God.  His sacrifice atoned for *all* of\\nour sins, past present and future.  God does not require pennance for\\nour sins, nor does he require us to come up with our own atonement.

Instead of rationalizing our own fears and\\nphobias, we need to be reaching out to people with AIDS and other\\nsocially unacceptable diseases.  Whether they got the disease through\\ntheir own actions or not is irrelevant.  They still need Jesus Christ,\\nno more and no less than we do.

       " '\\n\\tThe first and only thing I\\'ve ever tried to auto-trace was a piece\\nof a USCG nautical chart using Adobe Illustrator 3.2.  I wanted to get the\\noutline of the coast for Western Long Island Sound.  I was simultaneously\\nsuprised at how good a job it did and disappointed at how poorly it did.  I\\nsuspect what I gave it was a very difficult thing; not only is the coastline\\nvery irregular, but overlaid on the chart are numerous sets of gridlines\\n(not only lattitude and longitude, but loran grids as well).  The most\\ncommon mistake it make was whenever the coastline was roughly parallel and\\ntangent to a grid line, it would take off following the gridline instead of\\nthe coast.  I think the best improvement would be some sort of interactive\\nalgorithm that would let you step in and say \"no, dummy, you\\'re going the\\nwrong way\".\\n\\n\\tSteve Reisberg, a friend of mine a few years back(*), did his\\ndoctoral work analysing electron micrographs of filimentous phage (virii).\\nA good chunk of the work was writing a program to take a digitized\\nmicrograph and automatically trace the centerline of the virus particles.\\nThis is essentially the same problem that Illustrator tries to solve with\\nits auto-trace tool.\\n\\n\\tIn some respects the problem Steve worked on was harder, since he\\nwas trying to do quantitative analysis of the virus structure and finding a\\ngood centerline was only the first step, but a step on which all future\\nanalysis depended.  However, in other respects, it was an easier problem\\nsince the program could be written with a lot of knowledge about what the\\nvirus particles were supposed to look like, and the analysis could be\\nrestricted to those particles which happend to be relatively straight,\\nclean, and well imaged; you don\\'t always have that freedom auto-tracing real\\nlife images.  In any case, it gave me some insight into just how difficult\\nthis problem is to solve in the general case.\\n\\n\\t(*) Steve is no longer with us.

The article\\nincluded photos of the many furnishings that have already been made in\\npreparation for furnishing the rebuilt temple according to the\\nspecifications given in the Bible. \\n\\nWhat was even more striking is the fact that the plans for the temple are\\ncomplete and the group is only awaiting permission from the Israeli\\ngovernment before beginning the building. The other startling fact is the\\nvery recent archeological discovery that the original site of the temple is\\nunoccupied and available for building. Previously it has been thought that\\nthe original site was underneath what is now a mosque, making rebuilding\\nimpossible without sparking a holy war. \\n\\nNow it appears that nothing stands in the way of rebuilding and resuming\\nsacrifices, as the Scriptures indicate will happen in the last days.\\nAlthough the Israeli government will give the permission to start, I think\\nit is the hand of God holding the project until He is ready to let it\\nhappen.

       " 'Michael Bushnell writes;\\n\\n\\nWhich is exactly what I pointed out.  (Though I was wrong about your use\\nof the Creed, the 1913 Catholic Encylcopedia in which I read about it\\nsaid the Orthodox do use the Creed minus the filioque.  Apparently that\\nhas changed.)  The Athanasian Creed has always had the Filioque, the\\nNicene - Constantinopolitan did not.\\n\\tOf course the Orthodox did not delete the Filioque from the Nicene\\nCreed (it wasn\\'t there to begin with), but they certainly did from the\\nAthanasian Creed, which did have it from the beginning.\\n\\tI might point out that the whole problem started over the difference in\\nways of explaining the generation of the Blessed Trinity, the East\\nemphasizing the idea of the Holy Spirit proceeding from the Father\\nthrough the Son, and the West using proceeding from the Father and the\\nSon.  In fact, some, such as Tertullian, used both formulations (see\\nbelow)\\n\\n\\t\"Following, therefore, the form of these examples, I profess that I do\\ncall God and His Word, - the Father and and His Son, - two.  For the\\nroot and the stem are two things, but conjoined; the fountain and the\\nriver are two kinds, but indivisible; the sun and the ray are two forms,\\nbut coherent ones.  Anything which proceeds from another must\\nnecessarily be a second to that from which it proceeds; but it is not on\\nthat account separated from it.  Where there is second, however, there\\nare two; and where ther is third, there are three.  The Spirit, then, is\\nthird from God and the Son, just as the third from the root is the fruit\\nof the stem, and third from the fountain is the stream from the river,\\nand thrid from the sun is the apex of the ray.\"\\n\\t-Tertullian, Against Praxeas, 8, 5 (about 213 AD)\\n\\nand\\n\\n\\t\"I believe that the Spirit proceeds not otherwise than from the Father\\nthrough the Son\"\\n\\t-Tertullian, Against Praxeas, 4, 1 (about 213 AD)\\n\\nAnd as St. Thomas showed in his Summa Theologica Part 1, Question 36,\\nArticles 2 and 3, there is no contradiction between the two methods of\\ngeneration, and in fact, the two methods of reckoning the procession\\nemphasize what St. Augustine, among others taught, that the Holy Spirit\\nproceeds from the Father and the Son, but He proceeds from the Father in\\na more preeminent way.\\n\\n\\t\"For whatever the Son has, He has from the Father, certainly He has it\\nfrom the Father that the Holy Spirit proceeds from Him ... For the\\nFather alone is not from another, for which reason He alone is called\\nunbegotten, not, indeed, in the Scriptures, but in the practice of\\ntheologians, and of those who employ such terms as they are able in a\\nmatter so great.  The Son, however, is born of the Father; and the Holy\\nSpirit proceeds principally from the Father, and since the Father gives\\nto the Son all that He has without any interval of time, the Holy Spirit\\nproceeds jointly from both Father and Son.  He would be called Son of\\nthe Father and of the Son if, which is abhorent to everyone of sound\\nmind, they had both begotten Him.  The Spirit was not begotten by each,\\nhowever, but proceeds from each and both.\"\\n\\t-St. Augustine of Hippo, The Trinity, 15, 26, 47 (400 to 416 AD)\\n\\nSo, in a sense, all of the formulations are correct (to the West at\\nleast), because the Holy Spirit proceeds from both Father and Son, but\\nin proceeding from the Son, the orgin of that procession is the\\nprocession from the Father, so the Holy Spirit is proceeding from the\\nFather through the Son, but as all that the Son has is from the Father,\\nthe Holy Spirit can be said to proceed from the Father, without any\\nmention of the Son being necessary.\\n\\tIn any case, I am happy to know that I follow in the beliefs of Pope\\nSt. Leo I, St. Fulgence of Ruspe, St. Cyril of Alexandria, Pope St.\\nDamsus I, St. Augustine of Hippo, St. Epiphanius of Salamis, St. Ambrose\\nof Milan, St. Hilary of Poitiers, Tertullian, and others among the\\nFathers, who all have very quotable quotes supporting the Catholic\\nposition, which I enunciated above.\\n\\tAs for the issue of the adoption of another Creed being forbidden, I\\nwill point out that the Holy Fathers of Ephesus and Chalcedon both spoke\\nof the Creed of Nicea in their statement forbidding anyone \"to produce,\\nwrite, or compose a confession of faith other than the one defined by\\nthe Fathers of Nicea.\"  That Creed is a different Creed than that of\\nConstantinople, which is commonly called the Nicene Creed.  Not of\\ncourse in that they were condemning the adoption of the\\nConstantinopolitan Creed, which is but an enlargement upon the Creed of\\nNicea, but that they were condemning the impious opinions of Nestorious,\\nwho had adopted a radically different Creed from the one used by the\\nChurch, which among other things denied the procession of the Holy\\nSpirit form the Son.  Thus, the additions of the Constantinopolitan\\nCreed were not thought to be in violation of this, and as the Council\\nChalcedon also affirmed the doctrine of the procession of the Holy\\nSpirit from the Son, which Nestorius denied, they could hardly have been\\nagainst explaining in a fuller way the Creed, for they themselves\\napproved of previous additions to it.  And if the further explanations\\nof the Creed made in Constantinople were not denigrating of the work\\ndone by the Holy Fathers of Nicea or in any way heretical, it follows\\nthat the Council of Toledo was fully able to add what was not disputed\\nby the faithful to the Creed so as to combat the impieties of the Arians\\nin Spain, because the filioque was not in dispute in the Church until\\nmany years later under Photius and others.  And that the filioque was\\nnot disputed, I provide more quotes below.\\n\\n\\t\"Since the Holy Spirit when he is in us effects our being conformed to\\nGod, and he actually proceeds from the Father and Son, it is abundantly\\nclear that He is of the divine essence, in it in essence and proceeding\\nfrom it.\"\\n\\t-St. Cyril of Alexandria, The Treasury of the Holy and Consubstantial\\nTrinity, Thesis 34, (423-425 AD)\\n\\n\\t\"The Holy Spirit is not of the Father only, or of the Son only, but he\\nis the Spirit of the Father and the Son.  For it is written: `If anyone\\nloves the world, the Spirit of the Father is not in him\\'; and again it\\nis written: `If anyone, however, does not have the Spirit of Christ, he\\nis none of His.\\'  When the Father and the Son are named in this way, the\\nHoly Spirit is understood, of whom the Son himself says in the Gospel,\\nthat the Holy Spirit `proceeds from the Father,\\' and that `He shall\\nreceive of mine and shall announce it to you.\\'\"\\n\\t-Pope St. Damasus I, The Decree of Damasus, 1 (382 AD)\\n\\n\\t\"The only-begotten Holy Spirit has neither the name of the Son nor the\\nappelation of Father, but is called Holy Spirit, and is not foreign to\\nthe Father.  For the Only-begotten Himself calls Him: `the Spirit of the\\nFather,\\' and says of Him the `He proceeds from the Father,\\' and `will\\nreceive of mine,\\' so that He is reckoned as not being foreign to the\\nSon, but is of their same substance, of the same Godhead; He is Spirit\\ndivine, ... of God, and He is God.  For he is Spirit of God, Spirit of\\nthe Father, and Spirit of the Son, not by some kind of synthesis, like\\nsoul and body in us, but in the midst of Father and Son of the Father\\nand of the Son, a third by appelation....\\n\\t\"The Father always existed and the Son always existed, and the Spirit\\nbreathes from the Father and the Son; and neither is the Son created nor\\nis the Spirit created.\"\\n\\t-St. Epiphanius of Salamis (which is on Cyprus), The Man Well-Anchored,\\n8 and 75 (374 AD)\\n\\n\\t\"Concerning the Holy Spirit, I ought not to remain silent, nor yet is\\nit necessary to speak.  Still, on account of those who do not know Him,\\nit is not possible for me to be silent.

       " '\\nThere are several types of copy protection, and the point is to make sure the\\nuser is using a legitimate copy.

       " 'Heres the life of St. MAria Goretti, posted with kind permission of\\nthe editor of the Australian Catholic Magazine \"Morning Star\".\\n\\nHope you like it.\\n\\n    Put up with anything to prevent sin St. Maria Goretti\\n\\n\\n\\n    Maria was born on October 16th 1890 to Luigi and Assunta Goretti,\\n    the  eldest  daughter  in the family of seven. She was a cheerful\\n    girl, always imitating her parents.  She had but one disire,  but\\n    one wish: to receive our Lord in the Blessed Sacrament.\\n\\n    The date was finally set for little Maria to receive our Lord  on\\n    the feast of Corpus Christi. For Maria, time seemed like an eter-\\n    nity as she  slowly  neared  the  great  day.   When  it  finally\\n    arrived, Fr. Jerome( the priest who was to celebrate the Mass and\\n    give the children their First Holy Communion) delivered a  sermon\\n    on\\tthe  immense love of Jesus Christ for them and the great love\\n    we should have in return for Him. He then warmly  urged  them  to\\n    die rather than commit a mortal sin.\\n\\n    Maria humbly approached the Altar of God and  received  the  Holy\\n    Eucharist.\\tHer  only  sadness  was  the  thought of her father\\'s\\n    absence, who died some time beforehand. As for the\\trest  of  the\\n    day,  Maria remained under the spell of the divine visit; that is\\n    until\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t   -4-\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    her thoughts changed to when she could go next to Holy Communion.\\n    Thus ended the happiest day of Maria\\'s life.\\n\\n    Over the next twelve months, Maria had changed  from  a  giggling\\n    little girl into a quiet young lady with responsibilities. As her\\n    mother went out into the fields in place of  her  husband,\\tMaria\\n    took  on the ironing, cooking, washing and other motherly duties.\\n    She was doing this not only for her own family, but also for  the\\n    Serenellis, a father and son who lived with the Goretti\\'s, owning\\n    a share in the farm. Although Maria was poorer than all the other\\n    children, she by far surpassed them in virtue. In all thi ngs she\\n    did the Holy Will of God.\\n\\n    During the month of June,  Alessandro  Serenelli(the  son)\\ttwice\\n    made advances upon Maria when he chanced to be alone with her. On\\n    both occasions Maria managed to  struggle  free  of  Alessandro\\'s\\n    strong  grip, but on the second, he threatened to kill her if she\\n    even uttered a word to her mother. From this day on, Maria\\tlived\\n    in terror, fearing lest Alessandro attack again.\\n\\n\\n    On July 5th 1902, Alessandro left work in the fields  to  \"get  a\\n    handkerchief,\"  as\\the  claimed. He went to the storeroom beneath\\n    the house where Maria, who was outside on the  landing  with  the\\n    baby,  could  hear him fumbling about in with tools. She wondered\\n    what he was doing. It was later learned that he was sharpening  a\\n    91/2\"  blade. He went to the house and called for Maria. She told\\n    him she wouldn\\'t go to him unless she knew why she was needed. He\\n    stormed out to the landing and dragged her up to her room. Mar ia\\n    instantly realized what he was up to. \"No, No, No! Do  not\\ttouch\\n    me!  It  is a sin, you will go to Hell!\" At this point Alessandro\\n    held the knife over Maria\\'s chest, who was now on the floor.\\n\\n    \"Will you or will you not?\" Maria gathered all her energy.\\t\"No I\\n    will  not,\\tAlessandro,  no!\"   She had chosen her martyrdom over\\n    sin, God over Satan.  Overcome with rage, Alessandro plunged  the\\n    knife  into   Maria\\'s  breast fourteen times.  Finally he came to\\n    his senses and thought Maria was dead.  Frantically he threw  the\\n    knife behind a closet and locked himself in his room.  The crying\\n    of the baby Teresa\\ton  the  landing  brought  the\\tattention  to\\n    Assunta  and the father of Alessandro. As the baby was unattended\\n    and was in danger of falling off, they ran to the house  to  find\\n    Maria,  who,  covered in blood, was dragging herself to the door.\\n    When asked what happened she said Alessandro  stabbed  her.   \"He\\n    wanted to make me do wrong and I would not.\"\\n\\n    The ambulance arrived, then the police who took Alessandro\\taway.\\n    As\\tthe  ambulance\\tcarried  Maria to the hospital, a large crowd\\n    followed on foot.  The doctors at the  hospital held no hope  for\\n    poor  little Maria.  The same Fr. Jerome who gave Maria her First\\n    Communion\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t   -5-\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    came to administer the last rites and to give her Holy  Viaticum.\\n    He asked Maria if she would forgive her murderer.  \"Yes.  For the\\n    love of Jesus I forgive him.  I wish for him to one day  join  me\\n    in\\tParadise.   May  God forgive him, for I alread y have.\" Maria\\n    died at about three o\\'clock.\\n\\n    Alessandro was tried  and  found  guilty  of  Maria\\'s  death  but\\n    because  of  his  age  he  was  sentenced to only thirty years in\\n    prison.  After eight  years of being a violent prisoner and show-\\n    ing  no regret for his crime, he saw in a dream, in the  midst of\\n    a field of flowers, Maria holding out a bunch of white lilies  to\\n    him.  Soon later he wrote to the local bishop, begging God\\'s par-\\n    don for the grave sin he had committed.  He later gave  testimony\\n    in\\tMaria\\'s  beatification in 1947.  Less than three years later,\\n    on Ju ne 24th 1950, Maria was canonised.  Assunta Goretti was the\\n    first mother ever to be present at her daughter\\'s canonisation.\\n\\n    May St. Maria Goretti help\\tus  to\\tbe  pure  and  grant  us  the\\n    strength to die rather than commit a mortal sin.\\n\\n    Saint Maria Goretti, pray for us.\\n\\n\\n    by Brendan Arthur\\n',\n",
